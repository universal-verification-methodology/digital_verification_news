| **[Verification Methodology for Debug Unit of a Superscalar RISC-V Processor](downloads/dvcon/4C3-DVCon_India_2024_Final_Paper_2603.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When it comes to verifying a Superscalar RISC -V processor’s Debug unit, the process involves not only verifying the Debug unit itself but also verifying its interactions with variety of processor configurations in addition to receiving external inputs from outside.  Verification poses several challenges, including configuring the processor with different settings, mixing instructions in the pipeline, and introducing external stimuli like interrupts, debug exceptions, and bus faults. During simulation, the processor is also subjected to random debug requests. Another challenge involves testing a range of instructions in debug mode with various debug control configurations. Correctness checking is crucial, requiring synchronization of asynchronous events with the Instruction Set Simulator and generating expected outcomes for register and memory updates.  The paper acknowledges the profoundness of the methodology published at DVCON US 2023 [1] in addressing these challenges in verifying a Debug unit of a Scalar RISC-V processor. However, when it comes to verifying a Debug Unit of a Superscalar RISC -V processor, it has limitations in halting the processor precisely  at a desired instruction with the “State Save and Restore” technique described in [1] . The paper meticulously examines these limitations and presents “Software Breakpoint” technique in which  the processor architecture guarantees precise halting at the desired instruction as part of the breakpoint implementation, irrespective of whether it is a Scalar or Superscalar processor.  The paper discusses how this technique is versatile and works well for processors with Instruction cache. Th is technique delivers  an average simulation speedup of 11% as compared to the “State Save and Restore” technique. The paper finally implements this technique  for the verification of Superscalar RISC -V processor’s Debug Unit demonstrating 100 percent functional and code coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Advance Hybrid Emulation Methodology for Accelerated Android Home Screen Bring-up and System Level Verification](downloads/dvcon/5B3-DVCon_India_2024_Final_Paper_2224.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— SoC Software bring-up and its validation are usually done at post-silicon stage, which can affect time to market a product, and cost of silicon re-spin. It is also difficult to debug hardware/software design bugs at post-silicon level because of less RTL design visibility. So early software bring-up and validation is very crucial. Therefore, Platform Teams need a high -speed model of the SoC months ahead of silicon availability to begin Software bring -up and application driver development. Because of Less Emulator driverClk frequency software bring -up cannot be done in FPGA based Emulation Verification environment. Therefore, Platform T eams need a high -speed model of the SoC , months ahead of silicon availability to begin Software bring-up and application driver development. To overcome less emulator speed and to accelerate Software development, Hybrid Emulation is developed. Hybrid emulation combines virtual prototyping and hardware emulation. To speed up the hybrid emulation, some components of SoC move from emulator to virtual side. So in hybrid Emulation, one part of SoC design runs at emulator and other part of design run in virtual platform. Virtual prototypes are high performance, System  C models of a particular IP, block or an entire SoC. These are modelling the behavior and inter-block communication at transaction level (TLM), which makes these faster than equivalent cycle-accurate RTL.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Unified UVM Testbench: Integrating Random, Directed and Pseudo-Random Verification Capabilities](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_132.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>- Most testbench environments use separate setups for random , pseudo-random, and directed verification strategies, leading to duplicate efforts and limited reusability. This fragmentation results in redundant development, inconsistent methodologies, and delays in verification cyc les. As projects progress —from directed tests early on to random exploration in the middle and pseudo -random patterns for targeted coverage closure toward the end — maintaining isolated environments becomes inefficient. The proposed solution is  a unified UVM -based testbench that integrates all verification modes into a single configurable environment. By supporting  mode selection through configuration, dynamic layering of sequences, and utilizing a reusable testbench library , this approach reduces overhead, enhances reusability from IP to SoC levels, and streamline s test development throughout the verification lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |
| **[Uncovering Hardware Vulnerabilities: Formal Verification for Security-Focused Negative Testing](downloads/dvcon/2C2-DVConIndia2025_Final_Paper_9003.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— Ensuring robust hardware security in increasingly complex and integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) designs require systematic, formal, and scalable methodologies. This paper presents a category-driven framework that unifies the Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability (CIA) triad with the rigor of formal verification, integrating both Security Path Verification (SPV) and Formal Property Verification (FPV). We detail a ten-category hardware security classification scheme aligned to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and demonstrate how security properties are systematically derived from this taxonomy. By employing CWE-driven property generation, strategic abstraction, relaxed constraint handling, and staged convergence, our methodology delivers comprehensive, reusable, and early-stage security verification. This approach enables efficient identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities, not only for confidentiality, but equally for integrity and availability, shifting hardware security left in the design lifecycle. The presented framework is broadly reusable, extensible, and provides actionable pathways for rigorous hardware security analysis in modern SoC environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |
| **[Transformation-Aided Verification of MAC Designs using Symbolic Computer Algebra](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_158.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—The increasing complexity of modern digital circuits requires robust verification to ensure reliability and prevent costly failures. Among various formal verification methods, Symbolic Computer Algebra (SCA) offers a powerful approach by representing circuits using polynomials. However, a significant challenge in SCA verification is the exponential term expansion during substitution, which drastically increases verification time. This paper addresses this challenge by investigating the impact of circuit transformations on SCA verification efficiency. We propose a transformation-aided verification process, showcasing its effectiveness through a case study on Multiply-and-Accumulate MAC-based designs. Specifically, we examine the transformation of NAND/NOR-based designs and demonstrate its substantial impact on verification time for certain MAC circuits. Experi- mental results reveal interesting findings, notably a many-fold performance gain for some benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

It involves huge manual effort even with the best of the tools available in the  market. In today’s world where NLP and LLMs are widely being used to solve problems in digital design verification, we propose TiDe model which can streamline the verification process at various levels. The model takes timing diagram as input directly fro m spec and generates: 1. Unit testcases for basic testing and 2. Assertions for Formal verification. When fine -tuned properly, TiDe model is highly effective in reducing the testbench development effort for both the design and verification engineers approximately 80% and 60% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[The Test Bench Factory: Building Verification Environments Faster, Better, Smarter](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_105.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— Code generation is a common solution for improving the productivity and adaptability of software. In the functional verification domain, for example, generators that model the hardware/software interface, or "configuration registers," of a design under verification are widely used in the industry. These generators help improve productivity, reduce repetitive tasks, ensure specification compliance, or simply overcome the "blank page syndrome”. In this paper, we present a test bench code generation approach that combines several technologies. This approach enables the creation of a fully functional SystemVerilog test bench using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The generated test bench covers the three main verification aspects: stimulus generation, checking and functional coverage. This approach significantly accelerates the development process, reduces test bench errors, and facilitates the reuse of verification components. By providing a standard architecture, users can avoid a steep learning curve when starting a new project.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

It comprises numerous clock component instances enabled with dynamic control to establish Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Hardware Controlled Auto Clock Gating (HWACG) schemes, effectively contributing to overall performance and power optimization [1].  Due to increasing complexity and stringent performance requirements, the verification of the CTN has also become more intricate.  This paper presents a robust verification strategy with Clock Monitor (CLKMON), a custom verification module developed to monitor, analyze and validate dynamic nature of CTN .  “Accelerated Clock Reference Model Generator” (ACRMG), an in -house tool developed to automate CTN analysis [2], is used to integrate  the CLKMON for all the IP clocks .  The paper also presents how CLKMON is integrated with various SOCs having different CTN topology. I.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Reduce, Reuse, Reverify: An efficient approach to transition formal verification environments from PCIe Gen6 to Gen7](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_124.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—As PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) technology advances, maintaining backward compatibility while optimizing performance for next-generation interfaces has posed a significant challenge. This paper explores the reuse of two existing PCIe Gen6 formal verification environment s for PCIe Gen7 by strategically using gearbox technique. The gearbox is a critical component in managing protocol timing to accommodate Gen7’s increased bandwidth. Through systematic refinement of the formal verification setup —including protocol constraints, timing assumptions, and data path configurations —we demonstrate an efficient transition from Gen6 to Gen7 without the need for a complete environment overhaul. This approach significantly reduces verification effort and acc elerates the validation process for next-generation PCIe designs. The proven results confirm that with targeted modifications, the Gen6 verification infrastructure can effectively validate Gen7 implementations, ensuring compliance with new specifications while leveraging prior investments in formal verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Real Number Voltage aware behavioral modeling and verification of SRAM subsystem with Unified Power Format (UPF)](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_131.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— Power management in modern  SoCs is becoming increasingly complex due to several evolving factor s and  design intricacies as compared to earlier times . To support this increased functionality while respecting strict power budgets  of these SoCs  , chips need to be designed to operate efficiently in various low -power modes . Such complex designs also need stringent low power verification techniques which can be performed  early in the design cycle to avoid late cycle debugging issues.  UPF IEEE 1801 standard [1] -based Soc verification for complex SoCs and subsystems plays a key role to verify the power management functions at RTL stage. This paper presents a solution of mimicking the power functional behavior using the real voltage values in digital simulations leading to voltage awareness in modeling of the power function of Ips and subsystems critical to achieve the power intent of the SoC. Using voltage-aware modeling with real-number voltage variables  allows designers to transact actual voltage values during RTL simulation thereby improving accuracy and verification coverage [2]of power critical blocks and systems. This modeling methodology is scalable and can be applied across a wide range of hard macro IPs and subsystems. This methodology is demonstrated through a memory subsystem comprising a Retention SRAM ( RETmem) and a Bias Generator (BIASG) block which is responsible for generating specific bias voltage for different RETmem operating modes as per the system’s low-power design requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Pre-Silicon Verification of Software Safety Mechanisms](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_163.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— Verifying software safety mechanisms for peripheral IPs presents a significant challenge during pre- silicon development, as these mechanisms require the entire System-on-Chip to execute. A software safety mechanism is a piece of software that detects hardware faults. This paper presents a novel hybrid verification approach that addresses this challenge by combining hardware emulation with software virtualization to enable comprehensive fault injection campaigns before silicon availability. Our architecture interfaces an RTL emulator running peripheral IP blocks with a host machine executing a virtualized CPU environment through a transaction-level interface. This hybrid approach provides signal-level accuracy while delivering practical execution times for fault campaigns. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two case studies: a memory-mapped SPI controller and the more complex NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA). For NVDLA, we implemented a progressive multiple-point fault injection methodology, revealing that neural accelerators demonstrate moderate vulnerability to single-point fault injection (10% accuracy loss), and become increasingly susceptible with multiple simultaneous faults injected (95% accuracy loss with 32 faults). Experimental results show the platform achieves 10× speedup over fully-emulated environments and 1000× acceleration compared to RTL simulation approaches, while utilizing only 0.12% of available resources. For the SPI controller, combining safety mechanisms achieved up to 96.3% fault detection rate, which aligns with ISO 26262 estimation for safety mechanisms. The methodology enables early vulnerability detection and refinement of safety mechanisms, supporting the timely development of ASIL-compliant automotive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Power Probe: Addressing Power Noise Signal Integrity Challenges for Wide IO HBM Memories Through Advanced Verification Approach](downloads/dvcon/4B3-DVCon_India_2024_Final_Paper_3654.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>: We are currently existing in an era where terms like Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning(ML) have become common household jargon. To cater for  the ever -growing demand for processin g large amounts of data, High Bandwidth Memory(HBM) was introduced as a solution. HBM addresses the demands like High Bandwidth with low latency memory accesses by providing a wider data bus with upto 2 64 bits of DQ, this means that the amount of data being processed per clock cycles is much more resulting in hi gher speed and efficiency. Since HBM memory is a 2.5D memory consisting of memory dies interconnected using through -silicon vias (TSVs), it offers relatively less latency than other traditional interconnection methods and higher packing density. However, this results in an increased amount of IOs opening up a larger margin for external as well as internal factors to affect its normal operation. Here, we are discussing the causes and resultant effects of one such prominent factor, power noise . We will be modelling its effects in the digital domain and simulate the results. Power noise, in of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), refers to fluctuations or disturbances in the power supply voltage experienc ed by the memory devices, PHY (Physical Layer), and associated components. These fluctuations can occur due to various factors such as rapid changes in current demand, impedance mismatches, parasitic elements in the power delivery network, and electromagnetic interference. The effects of power noise in HBM memory can be significant and can impact the memory system in several ways: 1. Bit Errors and Data Corruption: Power noise can induce fluctuations in the voltage levels of memory cells, leading to bit errors during read or write operations. These errors can corrupt stored data, resulting in data integrity issues. This also leads to increased bit error rate(BER). 2. Timing Violations : Power noise can disrupt the timing margins of memory operations, leading to violations of setup and hold times. When the timing constraints of memory interfaces are violated, it can lead to data setup failures or hold failures, resulting in data corruption or loss. 3. Reduced Operating Margin : Power noise can reduce the operati ng margins of the memory devices, causing them to operate closer to their specified limits. This reduction in margin can make the memory system more susceptible to variations in operating conditions, such as tempera ture fluctuations or voltage droops, potentially compromising its stability and reliability.

VESA's DisplayPort Automotive Extensions (DP AE) protocol adds automotive-grade functional safety and security to the existing DP and eDP standards. Chip manufactures have already started adopting DP AE for designing chipsets that will be part of future vehicles.

| **[Out of The Box Techniques for Data-Path Verification](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_139.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— Algorithmic datapath designs are typically modelled at a high level in C/C++ and can be verified at early stages before the corresponding RTL design is ready. The criticality for the equivalence verification of datapath designs (RTL) with their  reference high -level C/C++ models, is well accepted.  Simulation-based approaches like DPI or scoreboarding suffer from challenges of achieving verification completeness. The means of verifying this equivalence is shifting from simulation to formal gradually, thanks to new solver capabilities available in commercial formal tools and the exhaustive nature of formal.  However complex image processing algorithms often run into  the challenge of compiling i.e. building  the formal model from C++  of in reasonable time. Also, we often struggle to achieve proof convergence on the equivalence check targets, even if we manage to compile the C/C++ models. While formal methods can be potentially effective, the right methodology is required to  overcome these challenges and scale to larger and complex designs. In this paper, we propose several generic techniques  that have helped us to generate formal model s for FFT and  Decompression units in a couple of minutes and converge on the  properties which was impossible to achieve out of the box. In  this process, we uncovered bugs that  traditional verification methods failed to detect . All these techniques are reusable. This paper presents details of these techniques by taking an FFT and a Decompression algorithm as an example.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

C-based tests, essential for architectural and boot-path validation, traditionally lack the sophisticated modeling capabilities of UVM RAL, leading to inefficient, brittle tests and a high incidence of false failures from undocumented or complex register behaviors. This paper introduces a novel, automated methodology that systematically bridges this gap. We leverage UVM RAL as the reference source to generate portable, robust, and efficient C-compatible register test collaterals. The proposed flow utilizes a UVM sequence to extract comprehensive register metadata—including waivers and access policies—into an intermediate Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, which is then synthesized into C data structures. Furthermore, we detail an intelligent register pruning technique that reduced test suite execution time by over 60% in a production environment. This methodology enhances verification accuracy by seamlessly porting IP-level waivers to the SoC context, has directly led to the identification of 35+ critical design defects, and has fundamentally improved regression efficiency and time-to-market.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

This is due to the inherent nature of formal verification where the randomness of the inputs to the DUT help uncover scenarios where the design can fail based on the checks written. While this strength is best utilized by lightly constraining the inputs to see what the formal tools can uncover, they can pose a challenge when the design under test expects the inputs to be ordered across interfaces in a strict order. In this paper we talk about how we tackled this challenge using a novel method of using symbolic variables in a multi -dimensional map structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Novel Approach for Verification of Multi Die Booting Using Disruptive Distributed Simulation Methodology](downloads/dvcon/4A2-DVConIndia2025_Final_Paper_5352.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>- The BootROM, implemented as a small mask ROM or write -protected flash memory embedded within the processor chip is responsible for executing the first code when system is powered-up or reset. BootROM code is responsible for fetching all software binaries from external devices which includes the BL (Boot Loader), authenticate it and keep it in the system RAM. To enhance system security, the BootROM integrates AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) in the chip, checks the loaded BL for security, and provides personalized key management for the chips to prevent from cyber-attack. The ultimate goal of BOOTING is to fetch all BLs from external device and to bring up the OS (Operating System).  In the ever evolving era of chip manufacturing, conventional approaches of achieving functionality, form factor, cost and much demanding power/performance goals pave the way of transitioning to smaller process nodes [1]. However, manifold increase in compute/performance requirement has pushed the monolithic System on Chip (SOC) to sizes that are challenging to fabricate with acceptable yields. Additionally, the diminishing returns of advanced nodes have made it economically impractical to accommodate all o f the required logic, IO and memory for compute intensive applications within the limits of manufacturing equipment [1]. To address these limitations, chip designers are embraced with multi-chip and multi-die designs where larger designs are partitioned into smaller designs often referred as chiplets. These chiplets are then integrated into a single package for multi-die and different packages for multi -chip to achieve the desired form factor and power goals. Additionally, these approaches provide both scalability and flexibility to cater to different market segments and specific needs. Despite clear advantages of Multi -die/Multi-chip systems, numerous novel and distinctive challenges need to be addressed. Key verification challenges include availability of a scalable test bench to realize multi-chip/multi-die simulation, infrastructure limitation, homogeneous(multi-die) and heterogeneous(multi-chip) design and increase in simulation run time with debug complexities. This paper proposes a unique scalable app roach called “DISTRIBUTED SIM” to overcome all mentioned challenges within constrained verification timeframe. DISTRIBUTED SIM provides a distributed simulation approach where each individual die/chiplet has its own simulation and all simulations communicate with each other over socket at a specified time. Preliminary result shows a 10x improvement in test bench development, 20-30 % improvement in simulation time, 15 % improvement in processor usage and 10x reduction in resource requirement over a conventional single wrapper approach of   multi-die/multi-chip simulation. All these promising figures claim DISTRIBUTED SIM as a robust approach towards multi-die/multi-chip verification.

For all low power designs, power intent/UPF is a key and generating a clean UPF helps throughout the design flow and reduces the overall turnaround time of projects.  For complex SoCs, due to increase in physical partitions and supply rail restrictions for various partitions, can make UPF generation challenging, i.e. the UPFs that are being generated need to be physical implementation aware.  These generated UPF needs to be validated thoroughly to make sure UPF is clean from syntax, schematics, consistency w.r.t to power state tables and Implementation aspects and if any issues in the UPF constructs then it’s better to be caught earlier at the RTL stage itself so that issues can be fixed sooner and faster without involving implementation phase/cycle. VC LP static low power verification solution includes UPF Consistency Checks, Structural Power/Ground (PG) Checks and Functional checks and Architectural checks.  Traditional use models of VC LP allow to make sure UPF consistency w.r.t power state tables are clean at RTL stage and at Netlist stage, low power cells are correctly inserted that makes design structurally and electrically correct.  There is an increasing demand to catch and verify various Netlist stage low power issues at the RTL stage itself.  This will shift left the static verification of low power issues. Virtual instrumentation-based flow in VC LP shifts left the low power verification by instrumenting the isolation and level shifter cells in the design based  on the UPF strategies which subsequently leads to the more accurate verification of the design and save a lot of verification time at RTL and Netlist.

Their increased adoption in performance -driven architecture demands rigorous and complete formal convergence to ensure functional correctness across all corner cases. However, verifying these designs poses significant challenges: FMAs feature deep arithmetic pipelines and extended exponent widths, both of which enlarge the symbolic state space and exacerbate corner-case sensitivity. Traditional verification strategies —such as assume -guarantee reasoning, helper assertions or case-splits often struggle in this context. These methods rely on clean modularity and local reasoning, which break down in FMAs due to tightly coupled Datapath stages, nonlinear interactions between operand paths, and fused rounding logic. This complexity leads to state -space explosion, fragile constraints, and frequent tool timeouts, making convergence infeasible through standard approaches. We demonstrate a targeted proof decomposition methodology that systematically partitions the algorithm into smaller, logically coherent verification units such as pre -alignment, multiplication, normalization, and rounding stages — based on their structural and arithmetic characteristics. A key aspect of our approach is constraint migration, which ensures that high -level design assumptions and properties are seamlessly transferred and preserved throughout the verification process at the RTL level, maintaining consistency and correctness across abstraction layers. By aligning verification sub-problems with the solver strengths of different tools and leveraging constraint migration, we achieved exhaustive convergence in 4 –6 weeks—cutting down the formal closure timeline by over 50% compared to traditional approaches that typically require 12 –14 weeks for similar complexity designs. Applied to an industrial -grade single-precision FMA design with extended exponent width, our methodology demonstrates practical scalability and complete end-to-end signoff viability in real-world Datapath verification scenarios.

Symex is a symbolic execution framework speciﬁcally targeting anal- ysis of embedded software with requirements to safety, security, and dependability. However, so far, the execution engine of Symex has been executing the LLVM Intermediate Representation(LLVM-IR). Because no consistent mapping between LLVM-IR and actual machine code exists, Symex has been unable to provide guarantees to runtime properties of the system, such as Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET). In this paper, we extend Symex by moving the execution engine to General Assembly (GA), an Intermediate Representation (IR) capable of capturing the semantics of Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), along with their non-functional properties, e.g. per-instruction execution time, or power consumption. Symex lifts the ELF binary to GA and explores all reachable paths without approximations, thus it is able to provide guarantees to runtime characteristics of the system, taking into account architecture speciﬁc behaviour and compiler backend/linker optimizations. Furthermore, we introduce the EASY system analysis framework, which uses Symex as a symbolic execution backend, and therefore grants the same veriﬁcation capabilities. EASY can provide analysis for response time, task memory isolation and application stack memory utilization. We demonstrate the feasibility of GA-based symbolic execution by modelling the full ARMv6 and most of the v7 ISA, as well as the RV32I ISA. Leveraging on the Rust RTIC framework, we demonstrate that EASY is capable of automatically determining the schedulability, worst- case stack memory utilization and task memory isolation properties of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Traditional automation techniques —such as constrained random testing, assertion-based verification, and m etric-driven verification —have helped streamline the process but remain heavily manual in nature when it comes to planning, debug, and stimulus generation. The emergence of Generative AI (Gen -AI) has shown promise in domains such as software engineering and natural language processing; however, its application in hardware verification remains largely exploratory. Most attempts are ad hoc, lacking a structured way to assess where and how Gen -AI can be embedded into the verification lifecycle.

| **[Exploring the Limits of Vertical Reuse Automation in PSS-Driven SoC Verification](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_164.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—As  System-on-Chip  (SoC)  designs  integrate  increasingly  diverse  and  software-driven  components, verification reuse becomes critical for managing complexity across block, subsystem, and system levels. Despite advances in automation, the theoretical and practical boundaries of vertical reuse in complex SoC integrations remain underexplored. This paper investigates the limits of vertical reuse in Portable Stimulus Standard (PSS) workflows by applying a static analysis–based toolchain to a real-world SoC design. In PSS, reusable verification intent is captured as Portable Models (PMs), which combine abstract scenario definitions with realization-layer bindings to design interfaces. While prior work demonstrated that static analysis enables vertical reuse on designs of various sizes and complexities, this study examines how far such reuse can be extended as integration progresses toward full SoC levels. Using a Keccak-based cryptographic accelerator integrated through two distinct architectures — loosely coupled and tightly coupled — the feasibility of vertical reuse across six integration contexts is evaluated. The results show that static connectivity analysis supports reuse across hierarchy levels but that SoC-level reuse increasingly intersects with software-driven control, requiring additional modeling effort. This case study highlights both the reach and the limits of structural automation in enabling PM reuse, providing insight into when automation suffices and where additional modeling effort is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

To address this, the industry increasingly turns to Gate Level Simulation, tailored for specific IP and test features, despite its tediousness and high time -consuming nature. Thus, innovation is crucial for efficient SoC design verification, ensuring accuracy and reliability without compromising speed. Gate Level Emulation, executed on physical hardware, offers faster validation times due to higher clock frequencies (in the Mega Hertz range), making it ideal for Gate Level Verification while maintaining reliability. In this paper, we introduce a cutting -edge GLE framework featuring custom Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs) alongside an advance software test bench for design verification and debugging. Our platform is notable for its optimization techniques, which substantially enhance efficiency and benchmark its performance against two complex SoCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate this GLE platform's superiority over traditional GLS by highlighting a remarkable execution time improvement of 55X. Additionally, our test scenarios achieve around 60% greater coverage compared to conventional GLS. This robust GLE platform is implemented on the Cadence Palladium Z2 emulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

While SystemVerilog UVM remains the industry-standard verification framework of- fering constrained-random testing, functional coverage, and scalable environments, its steep learning curve and limited interoperability with modern software tools present notable challenges. This study explores an alternative approach using Python-based verification integrated with commercial simulators and compares it against a traditional UVM methodology. We implement two functionally equivalent verification environments for a UART IP core with an APB interface: a conventional SystemVerilog UVM testbench, and a Python-based solution combining pyuvm’s structured verification components with cocotb’s co-simulation capabilities. Both environments utilize industry-standard licensed simulators, ensuring a fair and practical comparison. Our evaluation focuses on four key metrics: simulation performance, func- tional coverage efficiency, testbench maintainability, and component reusability across projects. Generally, results shows that Python-based verification can effectively complement traditional UVM flows, especially in unit-level verification scenarios, where rapid development, dynamic stimulus generation, and seamless integration with modern software stacks offer significant advantages. Although UVM remains favorable for large-scale SoC verification due to performance and maturity, the Python-based approach presents a compelling alternative for targeted use cases in commercial verification environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

This paper presents an efficient debug methodology for complex PCIe ®  Gen6 designs using Cadence's PCIe Gen6 Verification IP (VIP). We focus on two key aspects: leveraging the VIP’s built-in protocol checking capabilities and utilizing trace file logs to streamline debug and analysis. The proposed approach embeds Cadence VIP as a smart agent in the testbench to automatically flag specification violations across transaction, data link, and physical layers. When issues arise, a user can utilize detailed trace files generated by the VIP to quickly pinpoint protocol errors and timing mismatches. We will demonstrate how this combination of proactive protocol checks and trace-driven debugging accelerates root-cause analysis in a PCIe Gen6 environment. Our strategy enables faster identification of FLIT format errors and credit exhaustion, reducing debug time by a significant margin. The results show improved verification efficiency, thorough coverage of PCIe 6.0 features, and insights that can be applied to other complex interface protocols.

Formal verification provides precise correctness guarantees but is constrained by computational overhead and scalability issues. Conversely, simulation-based approaches, including constrained- random verification and fuzz testing, provide scalability but often lack systematic guidance to effectively cover critical design regions and rarely exercised state transitions. To overcome these challenges, we propose Formal-Guided Test Sequence Optimization (FGTSO), a framework that integrates formal verification with simulation to systematically target coverage holes and enhance verification efficiency. FGTSO mitigates false alarms by refining formal assumptions and resolving black-box (BBOX) limitations through abstraction modeling. By continuously align- ing formal and simulation environments, FGTSO reduces test redundancy while enabling precise corner-case exploration. This approach enhances verification completeness, efficiently covering hard-to-reach design be- haviors that traditional methodologies often overlook. Experimental results on the CV A6 RISC-V core show that FGTSO achieved 99.91% branch coverage within 8 days, which is 4.41% higher than HyPFuzz’s 95.5%, effectively covering 98% of the previously uncovered regions. Furthermore, within 10 days, FGTSO achieved 100% coverage across all key metrics, including line, toggle, condition, and branch coverage. These results validate FGTSO’s ability to identify complex corner-case behaviors that traditional methods fail to reach, significantly enhancing verification completeness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Size of monolithic SoCs for Generative AI, hyperscalers & enterprise grade data-centre applications is becoming too big for manufacturability . With increasing complexity and number of ga tes, simulation time is also increasing and the adoption of ne xt-gen verification  techniques are on the rise. With the emergence of complex multi-die SoC designs to tackle yield issues on advanced manufacturing nodes, the challenges in verification have increased manifold. This involves integration of pre-verified IPs, sub-systems, and partially verified chiplets using multiple vendor simulator platforms and Verification IPs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of ASIC breakthroughs. With time to market being a critical factor, adherence to aggressive schedules has become the new normal. Rebuilding these complex verification environments onto a multi-die SoC testbench in the given timelines is extremely challenging.

To accelerate this process, modern ASIC and SoC development flows utilize parallel design representations at different levels of abstraction, commonly virtual prototypes (VPs) alongside RTL and mixed-signal design. However, failing to maintain consistency among design representations can undermine the advantages of utilizing them in parallel, compromising quality and delaying time -to-market. This paper addresses the critical issue of ensuring consistency among system specifications, mixed-signal design representation, VPs, and software throughout ASIC and SoC development. Our approach focuses on applying the same use case scenarios across all design representations, which in turn enhances the verification of digital and mixed -signal designs using the real-world scenarios themselves and allows for the validation of overall system functionality when hardware and software designs operate together. We propose an automated method for use case mapping between abstraction levels (VP to RTL and vice versa) relying on  signal trac es recorded in VCD file besides small set of refinement information  to facilitate essential timing adjustments and manage signal interdependencies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a case study to verify a production automotive ASIC design, reporting quantitative measures of accuracy and effort reduction, as well as qualitative findings that enhanced verification strategy at early stage of the project.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

This paper proposes an AI -enabled formal verification approach, integrating Artificial Intellig ence (AI) into every step, from property extraction to proof convergence, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated property generation, abstract model creation, and building a comprehensive database of verification information. AI intelligently classifies, sorts, and reuses properties to reduce complexity, enhancing formal property verification (FPV) and datapath validation (DPV) through design decomposition and formal engine orchestration. Convergence techniques such as abstraction and propert y decomposition are employed to address state - space explosion, ensuring faster and more accurate verification. Comprehensive verification is ensured through analysis of coverage metrics, including cone -of-influence, formal core, and testbench analysis, gua ranteeing thorough verification before sign-off. AI-driven analytics and detailed reporting simplify debugging and design optimization, while the systematic flow improves accuracy, scalability, and productivity, ultimately achieving faster, confident signoffs.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

However, the lack of full support for constrained randomization, a cornerstone of UVM-based verification, has remained a major limitation. This paper presents our extension to Verilator’s randomization capabilities, adding support for aggregated data types such as structs, unions, and arrays, with both basic and constrained randomization. We introduce an optim ized, template -based architecture that handles these complex types efficiently without compromising performance. To validate the implementation, we developed three UVM testbenches with varying structures and complexities, all verified on QuestaSim and then  tested on Verilator. The results highlight both the current capabilities and remaining limitations of Verilator in supporting UVM environments. This work closes a critical gap, advancing Verilator toward a fully capable open-source solution for UVM-based verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Ensuring data integrity by preventing corruption, duplication, dropping, or reordering is key to validate system correctness. However, verifying data integrity using Formal Verification (FV) becomes highly challenging in packet-based designs where complex packing rules, shifting, and alignment introduce possibilities of subtle and hard-to-detect issues. The challenge intensifies in PCIe 6.0, where TLP Bytes are packed into Flits under strict packet packing rules involving frequent data shifting and alignment. Traditional FV data integrity techniques ineffective when designs modify or partially shift input data before sending it to output. In this paper, we present our array based novel data integrity approach called Array Centric Tracking (ACT), a scalable technique that tracks input TLP Bytes across Flits to validate data integrity and packing rules. We demonstrate various applications, benefits of ACT and caught 38 bugs using our approach including many subtle corner cases that traditional verification methods failed to catch.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

In large SoC projects,design blocks are a mix of new, reused, and slightly modified IPs. A common challenge arises when DV engineers, particularly those new to a reused block, encounter test failures and must rely on colleagues with prior experience for debug guidance. This dependency often leads to delays, especially when team members are unavailable or distributed across time zones. This paper presents a novel, experience-driven debug assistance tool designed to reduce this dependency and accelerate the debug process. The tool captures and stores error signatures observed, along with their most probable root causes, effectively mimicking the knowledge transfer that typically occurs between experienced and new verification engineers. When a test fails, the tool analyzes the failure pattern and provides likely debug pointers based on historical data, enabling engineers to resolve issues faster and more independently.

This paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to improve coverage closure time. We present an experiment involving the verification of a custom finite state machine (FSM), comparing results obtained through traditional constrained random verification with those enhanced by reinforcement learning.

This case study is based on a real project of a RADAR SoC (System On Chip) with a complex DSP (Digital Signal Processor) being embedded in the device. As part of the verification process, a model to generate the expected results for each of the DSP steps had to be implemented. In the first phase of the project, floating- point models to predict the results have been implemented in SystemVerilog. However, the implementation and the debugging of the models required a significant effort. Moreover, the incrementing complexity and the addition of new DSP features made the SystemVerilog models hard to maintain. In the second phase of the project, the algorithm team provided fixed-point MATLAB models matching the RTL implementation of each algorithm. The MATLAB models were reused by the verification team to replace the SystemVerilog floating-point models, allowing the team to focus on the implementation of testcases, checks, and coverage, rather than the implementation of the model . The transition from a floating -point model to a fixed -point model is also particularly important for t his kind of applications, since errors of one LSB could compromise the correctness of the results. The integration of the MATLAB functions was done by using SystemVerilog DPI (Direct Programming Interface), which allowed to easily reuse the MATLAB code fro m the testbench. This not only shortened the verification time and effort, but it also allow ed to reduce to the minimum the error tolerance used in the testbench checks.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel, fully automated, and configurable UVM-based verification environment tailored for a generic Ethernet controller RTL. The RTL design supports various features sets and configurations, including optional Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) layers, variable SerDes widths, and diverse data rates, all driven by RTL defines generated via a builder tool. To address  testbench customization overhead and avoid manual rework for each RTL variant , a Python-based flow was developed to parse RTL defines and dynamically generate a configuratio n-specific UVM top- level using Jinja2 templates. This produces a testbench-matching Device Under Test (DUT), supporting full-controller and PCS-only modes, with parameterized interface connections and module instantiations. The UVM components— agents, environments , and scoreboards  are implemented using  a flexible, parameter -driven architecture , enabling rapid adaptation to new RTL builds. Integrated with a Makefile-based flow, the methodology supports one-command generation of both DUT and testbench. Results show a significant reduction in bring-up time, full reuse of verification components, and successful deployment across multiple DUT variants  with zero manual edits .</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[A Graph-Based UVM Generation Framework for Complex State Machine Verification](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_135.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—The verification of complex designs  which include big control and protocol state -machines has always been a challenge. Although SystemVerilog and UVM have brought to the verification community the ability to create constrained random scenarios by means of test sequences and sequence libraries, the management of complex protocols from those sequences often lead s to spaghetti code, hard to maintain sequence libraries, directed tests or worse, not verifying all the targeted features. In parallel, we have seen the emergence of graph-based approaches resulting in the development of the PSS (Portable Stimulus Standard) , bringing the capacity to think differently a bout the use case scenarios, allowing them to be combined in a much bigger picture and enabling cross platform reuse. Those techniques are efficient at System Level  and for verification of complex SoC.  However, using them requires learning a new language, integrating new tools and are therefore less of an added value in complex IPs and subsystem projects already using UVM. Meanwhile, SystemVerilog provides interesting language constructs that can leverage standard UVM sequences for a more efficient constrained random generation, therefore accelerating the coverage closure of complex state machine designs. On the generation side, the randsequence keyword is powerful in generating graph-based scenarios providing that we stick to a well-structured template. Using its full capabilities  and adding a few tricks  we can even enable fully controlled graph explorations as well as automatic coverage closure completion, whether the design is fully controlled by the testbench or the testbench react s to the design behavior . On the coverage side, SystemVerilog covergroups allow the creation of state and state transition coverage. It is also possible to query the covergroups to check the completion of the scenarios. Integrated into a UVM sequence, we can define an automatic coverage closure graph-based scenario which will automatically cover all the required states and transitions of the design under test. This paper presents the overall approach, proposes an application proven template for the randsequence graph- based UVM sequence and leverages this by automating the template generation. A concrete example, based on the PCIe link training state-machine is then presented. The generation script and case example base class will be later provided as a gitlab project link  and an online generation tool available on www.aedvices.com/gbug (Graph Based UVM Generation)</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[Integration of Biomechanics and Digital Technology: Using Kinovea for Motion Analysis and Learning for Beginner Athletes](https://doi.org/10.58524/jcss.v4i2.890)** | 2029-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The integration of biomechanics with digital motion-analysis technologies has introduced new approaches for examining movement efficiency, kinematic characteristics, and technical patterns in walking and running activities. Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Coaching and Sports Science</p></details> |

Centralized reputation platforms can be opaque, censored and susceptible to become single points of failure, while decentralized ones face challenges, such as Sybil attacks, malicious strategies (e.g., ballot stuffing, bad-mouthing) exercised by entities of high influence, i.e. whales, and privacy concerns. This paper addresses these persistent issues by proposing a blockchain-based reputation framework that integrates robust identity verification, square root voting constraints, and dynamic stake-based incentives. Rating power is linked to the reputation of the rater that puts its reputation at stake. The model aims to ensure that reputation is earned and maintained through verifiable, community-aligned actions, while simultaneously limiting the potential for abuse by malicious actors or disproportionately influential participants. By leveraging decentralized identifiers, zero-knowledge proofs, and transparent incentive mechanisms, the proposed system seeks to balance transparency, fairness, and privacy. Extensive simulation experiments prove that the approach is effective to reveal the true quality of entities, even in presence of 49% colluding voters. The approach is designed to be adaptable across diverse domains, ranging from marketplaces and collaborative platforms to decentralized finance and governance.&lt;/p&gt;</p></details> |  |

Abstract This study examines identity fraud using a romance scam modus operandi on social media from the perspectives of criminal law and Islamic criminal law. The phenomenon is increasingly prevalent alongside digital technological advances that enable perpetrators to manipulate identities for emotional or financial gain. The research aims to analyze Indonesia’s positive law regulations regarding identity fraud through online romance scams, explore the Islamic criminal law perspective on such acts, and evaluate the effectiveness of law enforcement within the jurisdiction of the Jambi Regional Police. A qualitative method was employed using normative and empirical juridical approaches through literature studies, interviews with the Special Crime Directorate officers (Ditreskrimsus Polda Jambi), and a comparative analysis between positive law and Islamic criminal law. The findings reveal that identity fraud through romance scams is regulated under Article 378 of the Indonesian Criminal Code and Article 28 paragraph (1) in conjunction with Article 45A paragraph (1) of the Electronic Information and Transactions Law as an electronic-based fraud offense. However, its legal enforcement faces challenges such as digital evidence verification, tracking limitations, and cross-border jurisdiction issues. In Islamic criminal law, this act is classified as jarīmah ta‘zīr, a reprehensible act subject to discretionary punishment by the judge to uphold public welfare. Keywords: Identity Fraud, Romance Scam, Social Media, Criminal Law, Islamic Criminal Law.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Supporting Non-Destructive Testing Inspectors with a Multi-Modal Generative AI Copilot](https://doi.org/10.58286/32600)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-destructive testing (NDT) involves complex processes that are subject to numerous standards and expert knowledge. In addition, inspectors must handle heterogeneous inspection data, while existing digital tools typically support only isolated tasks, which motivates the need for an integrated and context-aware support system. To support inspectors through planning, analysis, and documentation in NDT, this work presents a concept of a multi-modal generative AI copilot tailored to computed tomography (CT) NDT inspections. Through workshops with related-industrial stakeholders and analyzing state-of-the-art literature, requirements and potentials of the generative AI copilot were derived and assessed. Based on the requirements an agent-based system architecture combining language processing and computer vision components was conceptualized and demonstrated in a prototype. Initial feedback from industry partners confirmed the relevance of the concept, verified that their requirements had been met, and provided information on further improvements and suggestions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sovereign Intelligence: The Strategic Architecture of Synaptic AI Lab and the Future of Indian AI Infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18549853)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1. Abstract The global artificial intelligence landscape is currently undergoing a bifurcation. While the first half of the 2020s was defined by the hegemony of Silicon Valley-based foundational models (e.g., OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic), the latter half of the decade is witnessing the rise of "Sovereign AI"—the strategic imperative for nations to own, host, and control their own intelligence infrastructure. Synaptic AI Lab Private Limited, a DPIIT-recognized DeepTech startup based in Kolkata, India, has emerged as a primary architect of this shift within the Indian subcontinent. Officially recognized by the Government of India (Certificate No: DIPP239197) and aligned with the IndiaAI Mission, Synaptic AI Lab is not merely an application-layer company but a foundational infrastructure provider. The company’s core value proposition addresses the "Linguistic Gap" and "Data Sovereignty" risks inherent in Western LLMs. By developing IndicGPT.com, trained on the proprietary Bharat-Vani Corpus (15 trillion tokens), and inventing the Brahmi-Net Tokenizer, Synaptic AI Lab has created a technological stack optimized for the 1.4 billion people of Bharat. This report analyzes the company’s technological innovations, its "Synaptic Stack" product ecosystem (including AiAstras, AiWalah, and Omnient), its revenue models, and the philosophical governance frameworks proposed by its founder, Abhijeet Sarkar. The analysis concludes that Synaptic AI Lab represents a critical asset in India’s digital public infrastructure (DPI), positioning itself as the "Neural Backbone" of the nation's AI economy. 2. The Geopolitical Mandate: Why Sovereign AI? 2.1 The Threat of Data Colonization In the digital age, data is the primary factor of production. For nations in the Global South, the reliance on API-based intelligence provided by foreign entities constitutes a form of "Data Colonization." When Indian enterprises, government bodies, and citizens utilize Western LLMs, critical data—ranging from financial transactions to cultural nuances—exits national borders, processed on servers in Oregon or Virginia. This creates three strategic vulnerabilities: Privacy & Security Risks: Sensitive national data is subject to foreign surveillance laws and corporate data harvesting. Economic Rent-Seeking: The value generated from Indian data is captured by foreign platforms, turning the nation into a consumer rather than a producer of intelligence. Cultural Erasure: Models trained primarily on the "Common Crawl" of the English internet often hallucinate or fail when processing Indic languages, leading to a homogenization of thought and a loss of "Civilizational Memory." 2.2 The Synaptic AI Solution Synaptic AI Lab defines its mission as "Architecting Sovereign Intelligence." This is not an isolationist stance but a strategic one. By building the entire stack—from the tokenizer to the foundational model to the agentic orchestration layer—indigenously, the company ensures that: Data Residency: All processing occurs within Indian jurisdiction, compliant with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act. Cultural Alignment: Models are fine-tuned on the Bharat-Vani Corpus, ensuring they respect Indian cultural contexts, historical truths, and linguistic diversity. Economic Sovereignty: The intellectual property and revenue streams remain within the Indian economy, contributing to the $17B Generative AI opportunity projected for the nation. 3. Technological Deep Dive: The Core Infrastructure The competitive moat of Synaptic AI Lab is not its user interface, but its underlying technological architecture. The company has eschewed the easy path of simply wrapping GPT-4 APIs and has instead invested in training its own foundational models. 3.1 IndicGPT.com: The Flagship Foundational Model IndicGPT is the flagship Large Language Model (LLM) of Synaptic AI Lab. Unlike general-purpose models that treat Indian languages as edge cases, IndicGPT treats them as first-class citizens. 3.1.1 The Bharat-Vani Corpus The efficacy of an LLM is a function of its training data. Most global models are trained on datasets where English constitutes 90%+ of the tokens. Synaptic AI Lab has curated the Bharat-Vani Corpus, a colossal dataset comprising 15 trillion tokens across 40+ Indian languages and dialects. Sources: The corpus aggregates data from digitized Indian literature, government archives, regional news media, and transcribed oral histories, ensuring a density of "high-context" cultural data that web scraping alone cannot achieve. Impact: This allows IndicGPT to understand high-resource languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil) and low-resource dialects (Bhojpuri, Magahi, Tulu) with near-native proficiency. 3.2 The Brahmi-Net Tokenizer: A Paradigm Shift Perhaps the most significant technical breakthrough by Synaptic AI Lab is the Brahmi-Net Tokenizer. 3.2.1 The Tokenization Problem in Western Models Standard tokenizers (like Byte-Pair Encoding or BPE) used by models like Llama or GPT-4 are optimized for Latin scripts. When they encounter Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.), they often fragment words into excessive sub-tokens. Example: The Hindi word "अनुसंधान" (Research) might be broken into 6-7 meaningless byte chunks by a standard tokenizer. Result: This increases inference costs (more tokens to process), increases latency, and degrades semantic understanding. 3.2.2 The Brahmi-Net Solution The Brahmi-Net architecture is a script-aware tokenizer designed specifically for the Abugida writing systems of South Asia. Phonetic Grouping: It utilizes the inherent phonetic logic of Brahmic scripts (where consonants carry inherent vowels) to tokenise efficiently. Unified Representation: It maps similar phonetic sounds across different scripts (e.g., the 'k' sound in Bengali and Tamil) to shared latent spaces, allowing for "Zero-Shot" translation and reasoning between Indian languages. Efficiency: Brahmi-Net reduces the token count for Indic text by up to 40% compared to standard BPE tokenizers, making IndicGPT significantly faster and cheaper to run on Indian hardware. 4. The Product Ecosystem: The Synaptic Stack Synaptic AI Lab has built a vertical stack of applications on top of its core infrastructure, targeting distinct market segments: Enterprise, Education, and Consumer. 4.1 AiAstras.com: The Agentic Workforce Target Market: Enterprise, BFSI, Healthcare Value Prop: Autonomous AI Agents with Data Residency While IndicGPT provides the "brain," AiAstras provides the "hands." It is an orchestration platform for deploying Autonomous AI Agents. Unlike chatbots that wait for a prompt, these agents can plan, reason, and execute complex workflows. Use Case: A "Banking Agent" on AiAstras can autonomously verify a CIBIL score, analyze loan documents, and approve a loan application (Level 4 Security) without human intervention, all while ensuring the financial data never leaves the bank's private cloud. Technology: The platform utilizes "Neuro-Agents" capable of multi-step reasoning and tool use, supporting vernacular languages for rural banking integration. 4.2 AiWalah.com: The EdTech Revolution Target Market: Students, Rural India, Upskilling Value Prop: AI Education in Native Languages AiWalah.com addresses the "AI Divide." Recognizing that English literacy should not be a prerequisite for AI literacy, this platform offers comprehensive AI education in 27+ Indian languages. Mission: "AI education for every person on this planet in their native language." Features: Interactive courses, AI-assisted coding environments, and certification programs designed to upskill the Indian workforce for the machine age. 4.3 Omnient.io: The Vibe Coding Engine Target Market: Developers, Startups, SMEs Value Prop: Text-to-App Generation Omnient.io represents the company's foray into the "No-Code/Low-Code" space. Dubbed the "Vibe Coding Engine," it allows users to describe a software application in natural language (including Indian languages) and generates full-stack code instantly. Strategic Fit: This empowers millions of Indian SMEs to digitize their businesses without hiring expensive engineering teams, fostering a new wave of grassroots entrepreneurship. 4.4 ZodiXAI.com: Cultural AI Target Market: Consumer (B2C) Value Prop: Vedic Astrology powered by LLMs ZodiXAI.com demonstrates the "Cultural Alignment" of Synaptic’s models. It combines the rigorous mathematical calculations of Vedic Astrology with the reasoning capabilities of AI to provide personalized horoscopes. This serves as a potent demonstration of the model's ability to handle specialized, culturally specific knowledge bases (Sanskrit scriptures and planetary algorithms). 4.5 Drishti-Geo Intelligence Target Market: Defense, Urban Planning, Agriculture Value Prop: Geospatial AI Expanding beyond text, Drishti-Geo applies computer vision to satellite imagery. It is tuned for Indian topographies, aiding in: Agriculture: Crop yield estimation and pest detection. Defense: Automated surveillance of border regions. Urban Planning: Monitoring unauthorized construction and infrastructure development. 5. Economic Framework: The Path to Profitability Synaptic AI Lab has structured a robust, diversified revenue model designed for scalability and sustainability. 5.1 Enterprise Licensing (High Value / Recurring) The core revenue driver is the licensing of foundational models and the AiAstras platform to large enterprises. On-Premise Deployment: For banks and defense sectors, Synaptic deploys models within the client's air-gapped servers, charging annual licensing fees. This guarantees 100% data sovereignty. 5.2 API Consumption (High Volume / Scale) Similar to OpenAI's API model, Synaptic charges developers on a "per-token" basis for accessing the Synapse Cloud API.

Impact: This allows IndicGPT to understand high-resource languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil) and low-resource dialects (Bhojpuri, Magahi, Tulu) with near-native proficiency. 3.2 The Brahmi-Net Tokenizer: A Paradigm Shift Perhaps the most significant technical breakthrough by Synaptic AI Lab is the Brahmi-Net Tokenizer. 3.2.1 The Tokenization Problem in Western Models Standard tokenizers (like Byte-Pair Encoding or BPE) used by models like Llama or GPT-4 are optimized for Latin scripts. When they encounter Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.), they often fragment words into excessive sub-tokens. Example: The Hindi word "अनुसंधान" (Research) might be broken into 6-7 meaningless byte chunks by a standard tokenizer. Result: This increases inference costs (more tokens to process), increases latency, and degrades semantic understanding. 3.2.2 The Brahmi-Net Solution The Brahmi-Net architecture is a script-aware tokenizer designed specifically for the Abugida writing systems of South Asia. Phonetic Grouping: It utilizes the inherent phonetic logic of Brahmic scripts (where consonants carry inherent vowels) to tokenise efficiently. Unified Representation: It maps similar phonetic sounds across different scripts (e.g., the 'k' sound in Bengali and Tamil) to shared latent spaces, allowing for "Zero-Shot" translation and reasoning between Indian languages. Efficiency: Brahmi-Net reduces the token count for Indic text by up to 40% compared to standard BPE tokenizers, making IndicGPT significantly faster and cheaper to run on Indian hardware. 4. The Product Ecosystem: The Synaptic Stack Synaptic AI Lab has built a vertical stack of applications on top of its core infrastructure, targeting distinct market segments: Enterprise, Education, and Consumer. 4.1 AiAstras.com: The Agentic Workforce Target Market: Enterprise, BFSI, Healthcare Value Prop: Autonomous AI Agents with Data Residency While IndicGPT provides the "brain," AiAstras provides the "hands." It is an orchestration platform for deploying Autonomous AI Agents. Unlike chatbots that wait for a prompt, these agents can plan, reason, and execute complex workflows. Use Case: A "Banking Agent" on AiAstras can autonomously verify a CIBIL score, analyze loan documents, and approve a loan application (Level 4 Security) without human intervention, all while ensuring the financial data never leaves the bank's private cloud. Technology: The platform utilizes "Neuro-Agents" capable of multi-step reasoning and tool use, supporting vernacular languages for rural banking integration. 4.2 AiWalah.com: The EdTech Revolution Target Market: Students, Rural India, Upskilling Value Prop: AI Education in Native Languages AiWalah.com addresses the "AI Divide." Recognizing that English literacy should not be a prerequisite for AI literacy, this platform offers comprehensive AI education in 27+ Indian languages. Mission: "AI education for every person on this planet in their native language." Features: Interactive courses, AI-assisted coding environments, and certification programs designed to upskill the Indian workforce for the machine age. 4.3 Omnient.io: The Vibe Coding Engine Target Market: Developers, Startups, SMEs Value Prop: Text-to-App Generation Omnient.io represents the company's foray into the "No-Code/Low-Code" space. Dubbed the "Vibe Coding Engine," it allows users to describe a software application in natural language (including Indian languages) and generates full-stack code instantly. Strategic Fit: This empowers millions of Indian SMEs to digitize their businesses without hiring expensive engineering teams, fostering a new wave of grassroots entrepreneurship. 4.4 ZodiXAI.com: Cultural AI Target Market: Consumer (B2C) Value Prop: Vedic Astrology powered by LLMs ZodiXAI.com demonstrates the "Cultural Alignment" of Synaptic’s models. It combines the rigorous mathematical calculations of Vedic Astrology with the reasoning capabilities of AI to provide personalized horoscopes. This serves as a potent demonstration of the model's ability to handle specialized, culturally specific knowledge bases (Sanskrit scriptures and planetary algorithms). 4.5 Drishti-Geo Intelligence Target Market: Defense, Urban Planning, Agriculture Value Prop: Geospatial AI Expanding beyond text, Drishti-Geo applies computer vision to satellite imagery. It is tuned for Indian topographies, aiding in: Agriculture: Crop yield estimation and pest detection. Defense: Automated surveillance of border regions. Urban Planning: Monitoring unauthorized construction and infrastructure development. 5. Economic Framework: The Path to Profitability Synaptic AI Lab has structured a robust, diversified revenue model designed for scalability and sustainability. 5.1 Enterprise Licensing (High Value / Recurring) The core revenue driver is the licensing of foundational models and the AiAstras platform to large enterprises. On-Premise Deployment: For banks and defense sectors, Synaptic deploys models within the client's air-gapped servers, charging annual licensing fees. This guarantees 100% data sovereignty. 5.2 API Consumption (High Volume / Scale) Similar to OpenAI's API model, Synaptic charges developers on a "per-token" basis for accessing the Synapse Cloud API.

| **[Quantitative Perceptual Analysis of Feature-Space Scenarios in Network Media Evaluation Using Transformer-Based Deep Learning: A Case Study of Fuwen Township Primary School in China](https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings16040714)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the dual backdrop of the rural revitalization strategy and the pursuit of high-quality, balanced urban–rural education, optimizing rural campus spaces has emerged as an important lever for addressing educational resource disparities and improving pedagogical quality. However, conventional evaluation of campus space optimization faces two systemic dilemmas. First, top-down decision-making often neglects the authentic needs of diverse stakeholders and place-based knowledge, resulting in spatial interventions that lose regional distinctiveness. Second, routine public participation is constrained by geographical barriers, time costs, and sample-size limitations, which can amplify professional cognitive bias and impede comprehensive feedback formation. The compounded effect of these challenges contributes to a disconnect between spatial optimization outcomes and perceived needs, thereby constraining the distinctive development of rural educational spaces. To address these constraints, this study proposes a novel method that integrates regional spatial feature recognition with digital media-based public perception assessment. At the data collection and ethical governance level, the study strictly adheres to platform compliance and academic ethics. A total of 12,800 preliminary comments were scraped from major social media platforms (e.g., Douyin, Dianping, and Xiaohongshu) and processed through a three-stage screening workflow—keyword screening–rule-based filtering–manual verification—to yield 8616 valid records covering diverse public groups across China. All user-identifying information was fully anonymized to ensure lawful use and privacy protection. At the analytical modeling level, we develop a Transformer-based deep learning system that leverages multi-head attention mechanisms to capture implicit spatial-sentiment features and metaphorical expressions embedded in review texts. Evaluation on an independent test set indicates a classification accuracy of 89.2%, aligning with balanced and stable scoring performance. Robustness is further strengthened by introducing an equal-weight alternative strategy and conducting stability checks to indicate the consistency of model outputs across weighting assumptions. At the scenario interpretation level, we combine grounded-theory coding with semantic network analysis to establish a three-tier spatial analysis framework—macro (landscape pattern/hydro-topological patterns), meso (architectural interface), and micro (teaching scenes/pedagogical scenarios)—and incorporate an interpretive stakeholder typology (tourists, residents, parents, and professional groups) to systematically identify and quantify key features shaping public spatial perception. Findings show that, at the macro level, naturally integrated scenarios—such as “campus–farmland integration” and “mountain–water embeddedness”—exhibit high affective association, aligning with the “mountain-water-field-village” spatial sequence logic and suggesting broad public endorsement of ecological campus concepts, whereas vernacular settlement-pattern scenarios receive relatively low attention due to cognitive discontinuities. At the meso level, innovative corridor strategies (e.g., framed vistas and expanded corridor spaces) strengthen the building–nature interaction and suggest latent value in stimulating exploratory spatial experience. At the micro level, place-based practice-oriented teaching scenes (e.g., intangible cultural heritage handcraft and creative workshops) achieve higher scores, aligning with the compatibility of vernacular education’s “differential esthetics,” while urban convergence-oriented interdisciplinary curriculum scenes suggest an interpretive gap relative to public expectations. These results indicate an embedded relationship between public perception and regional spatial features, which is further shaped by a multi-actor governance process—characterized by “Government + Influencers + Field Study”—that mediates how rural educational spaces are produced, communicated, and interpreted in digital environments. The study’s innovative value lies in integrating sociological theories (e.g., embeddedness) with deep learning techniques to fill the regional and multi-actor perspective gap in rural campus POE and to promote a methodological shift from “experience-based induction” toward a “data-theory” dual-drive model. The findings provide inferential evidence for rural campus renewal and optimization; the methodological pipeline is transferable to small-scale rural primary schools with media exposure and salient regional ecological characteristics, and it offers a new pathway for incorporating digital media-driven public perception feedback into planning and design practice. The research methodology of this study consists of four sequential stages, which are implemented in a systematic and progressive manner: First, data collection was conducted: Python and the Octopus Collector were used to crawl online comment data related to Fuwen Township Central Primary School, strictly complying with the user agreements of the Douyin, Dianping, and Xiaohongshu platforms. Second, semantic preprocessing was performed: The evaluation content was segmented to generate word frequency statistics and semantic networks; qualitative analysis was conducted using Origin software, and quantitative translation was realized via Sankey diagrams. Third, spatial scene coding was carried out: Combined with a spatial characteristic identification system, a macro–meso–micro three-tier classification system for spatial scene characteristics was constructed to encode and quantitatively express the textual content. Finally, sentiment quantification and correlation analysis was implemented: A deep learning model based on the Transformer framework was employed to perform sentiment quantification scoring for each comment; Sankey diagrams were used to quantitatively correlate spatial scenes with sentiment tendencies, thereby exploring the public’s perceptual associations with the architectural spatial environment of rural campuses.</p></details> |  |

The background of the study is based on the problem of using a manual attendance system that is prone to manipulation and is less effective in supporting technology-based learning. This study uses a research and development method (R&amp;D) with the ADDIE model consisting of five stages, namely: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. The development results show that the digital attendance system is able to automatically record student attendance based on facial verification and GPS location when attendance is carried out. The system was developed using the AppSheet platform connected to Google Spreadsheet as a database. Validation was carried out by material experts, media experts, and student responses, which showed an average feasibility percentage of 91.1%, including the "Very Feasible" category. This learning media not only functions as an attendance recording tool, but also as a means of instilling character values through the application of technology. Thus, this system is expected to be an effective digital attendance solution while supporting the implementation of character-based learning and technology in madrasas.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-State Reliability Modeling and Evaluation of Islanded Microgrids with Semi-Active Hybrid Energy Storage Systems](https://doi.org/10.4108/ew.11843)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate reliability assessment of islanded microgrids (iMGs) increasingly depends on intelligent system modeling and data-driven integration between physical assets and digital control frameworks. To address the limited adaptability of conventional reliability models, this paper proposes an ICT-integrated framework for reliability evaluation of iMGs equipped with semi-active lithium-ion battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). The framework employs a 32-state Markov-based model to represent component-level degradation and failure dynamics, enabling state-aware reliability analytics through automatic state aggregation and transition probability learning. These states are further abstracted into representative operating modes that can be seamlessly interfaced with energy management systems for online evaluation. A minimum load curtailment strategy is embedded within a time-series Monte Carlo simulation environment to quantify the interactive impact between multi-state HESS behavior and overall system reliability. Standard indices-outage frequency, duration, and availability-are computed to characterize resilience under varying storage conditions. Comparative results verify that the proposed model substantially improves the reliability of iMGs by enabling degraded yet continuous operation during partial failures. The study provides a scalable and digitally implementable reliability framework for HESS-enabled microgrids, bridging the gap between detailed component modeling and real-time operational analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Methodology for Synthesizing an Integrated Logistics-Information System for Grain Delivery](https://doi.org/10.31649/2413-4503-2025-22-2-16-25)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The article presents a methodology for synthesising an integrated logistics–information system for grain delivery that addresses the contemporary challenges of digital transformation in the agricultural sector. The relevance of the study is determined by the need to enhance the efficiency of logistics processes, ensure cargo traceability, reduce operational costs, and comply with international standards of quality and safety management (ISO 22000, DSTU ISO 9001). The proposed methodology is based on a step-by-step synthesis of the system, which includes object formalisation, architectural design, scenario modelling, analytical optimisation, and verification. The system is conceptualised as a multi-level structure combining logistics, informational, and analytical components. The logistics level covers routes, schedules, vehicles, and infrastructure. The informational level incorporates telematics, IoT modules, ERP integration, and digital document management. The analytical level enables forecasting, route optimisation, risk assessment, and performance monitoring. Particular attention is paid to scenario modelling, which allows seasonal, climatic, technical, and organisational factors to be considered in transport planning. The study proposes a mathematical model of costs, quality functions of transportation, loading constraints, and efficiency criteria. An algorithm for system synthesis has been developed to ensure adaptability to environmental changes, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Verification of the methodology through pilot scenarios confirmed reduced costs, improved delivery accuracy, and decreased grain quality losses. The results of the study can be applied to the development of digital platforms for agricultural logistics management, preparation of technical documentation, accreditation materials, and the implementation of innovative solutions in transport systems of the agricultural sector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping Cultural Sentiments in Indonesian Digital Literature: An Annotated and Validated Multicultural Dataset](https://doi.org/10.54963/dtra.v5i1.1968)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops an annotated and validated multicultural sentiment dataset derived from Indonesian digital literature. The study integrates Cultural Sentiment Analysis (CSA) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to address a significant gap in existing research. No prior corpus has systematically combined cultural affective dimensions with linguistic and ethnographic validation, making this dataset crucial for mapping cultural value representations in a multicultural context. The corpus includes over 100 digital literary texts—short stories, online novels, and poems—sourced from platforms such as Wattpad, KBM App, and scholarly blogs, selected through purposive sampling to ensure diverse ethnic and thematic coverage. Annotation was carried out by trained annotators using a culturally grounded emotion lexicon, identifying sentiment polarity (positive, negative, and neutral), cultural values (social harmony, cooperation, spirituality, resistance, and adaptation), and linguistic indicators. Validation involved linguistic review for semantic accuracy and ethnographic verification through Focus Group Discussions with cultural experts from various ethnic groups. The resulting multi-layered dataset provides authentic, contextually grounded, and bias-mitigated representations of cultural sentiment in Indonesian digital literature. Beyond enriching digital humanities scholarship, it offers a reusable open resource for future research, automated sentiment analysis development, and data-driven policy formulation, all aimed at enhancing digital cultural literacy and intercultural understanding in Indonesia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Agricultural Supply Chain Resilience With Digital Transformation in “A Company+Farmers” Mode](https://doi.org/10.4018/ijabim.401116)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a lightweight solution for digital transformation in the “A Company+Farmers” mode, integrating an agricultural production enterprise and farmer suppliers into an inter-organizational alliance. A Chinese nationwide agricultural enterprise was investigated as a case study; its digital transformation, combining enterprise social networks and artificial intelligence (AI), proved to be a low-cost solution for supply chain collaboration. A survey was conducted by employing partial least squares structural equation modeling to verify positive impacts on dynamic capabilities in an alliance environment. The findings indicated that enterprise social networks facilitate information sharing while AI facilitates knowledge sharing, building sensing capabilities. Information sharing is more conducive to high-quality collaborative decision making, whereas knowledge sharing is more conducive to making high-quality adaptive decisions. AI has potential values in sharing knowledge across organizational boundaries, helping members know how to seize opportunities, reconfigure resources, and consequently enhance overall resilience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Indigenous perspectives on health information literacy during COVID-19: the Chakma community experience](https://doi.org/10.1108/pmm-10-2025-0070)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose This study investigates the digital dimensions of health information literacy (HIL) among the Chakma, Bangladesh's largest Indigenous ethnic group, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to characterize community competencies in information seeking, appraisal and use; map preferred information channels and verification practices and identify barriers and priorities for skills development and institutional engagement. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative, cross-sectional correlational survey was administered to a purposive sample of adult Chakma residents across Rangamati, Khagrachori and Bandarban. The questionnaire combined adapted, validated scales with a systematic localization procedure (translation/back translation, expert review and pilot testing); content validity and common method bias checks were performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics to examine relationships among digital engagement, source use, appraisal skills and HIL outcomes. Findings Respondents demonstrated strong awareness of health information needs and effective interpersonal communication with peers and local clinicians, and relied principally on broadcast media and familiar social networks for COVID 19 information. Notable gaps were observed in systematic source locating, retrieval and critical appraisal, limited use of libraries and formal telehealth channels and barriers related to technical terminology, online search skills and trust in authoritative sources. Community priorities emphasized internet and information education skill development and enhanced governmental and NGO awareness initiatives. Practical implications Findings call for dual track interventions that address infrastructure and language appropriate resource supply while delivering culturally tailored capacity building. Libraries, local clinics and community leaders are positioned as trusted intermediaries for targeted information literacy programs and anti-disinformation strategies. Originality/value By centering an Indigenous community often absent from pandemic information literacy research, this study elucidates how digital opportunities and constraints intersect with cultural practices and institutional landscapes. Findings inform culturally responsive HIL interventions, library and health system outreach and disinformation mitigation strategies tailored to Indigenous contexts.</p></details> |  |

He has conceived and led the development of the "Oncosimulators" i.e. the first digital twins/virtual human twins in oncology and beyond [2], [3]. Seven cancer types have been addressed by oncosimulators so far [2]. He participated upon invitation in the US research project "Center for the Development of a Virtual Tumor (CViT)" [Project # 5U56CA113004-03, NIH-NCI, led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Medical School (HMS)], where he introduced and presented the "Clinical Oncosimulator", developed at NTUA, on 10 April 2007 [2]. He conceived and led the development of the "Technologically Integrated Oncosimulator" (TIO) in the framework of the European Commission (EC) and Japan co-funded research project ACGT [2]. TIO was recognized as a "world first" by the EC in 2010 (end of the ACGT project) [2]. In 2010 GS proposed the approach of mimicking clinical studies in silico, a precursor of in silico clinical trials. In 2014 the advanced digital twin / virtual human twin "Technologically Integrated Oncosimulator", developed under the lead of GS was published in IEEE J. Biomed. Health Inform. (open access). GS coordinated - serving as both the overall and the scientific coordinator of - the "excellent" large scale EC funded EU-US research project CHIC on mechanistic multiscale hypermodeling, artificial intelligence (AI) and oncosimulators for in silico oncology (2013-2017). The outcomes of the project were designated as "great achievements" by the EC [2]. He participated as workpackage leader in several other competitive EC and nationally funded research projects addressing in silico medicine. In 2025 GS led the topic (special issue) titled "Multiscale cancer modeling, in silico oncology and digital (virtual) twins in the cancer domain" in Frontiers in Physiology (open access). He was editor and co-author in three regular papers and the editorial of the topic. He was one of the two initiators, scientific organizers and chairs of the groundbreaking First Transatlantic Workshop on Multiscale Cancer Modeling that was held in Brussels (EC-Charlemagne building) in 2008. The two scientific organizers were members of HMS-MGH (MD) and NTUA (PhD) respectively. The workshop was technically co-organized by the European Commission and the National Cancer Institute - NIH, USA [2]. [The video of G. Stamatakos's globally webcast opening lecture for the entire event, with special emphasis on in silico oncology, is openly available at https://ecancer.org/en/video/105-fundamentals-of-multiscale-modelling ]. He was one of the two editors and one of the co-authors of the transatlantic (US-EU) multiauthored textbook titled “Multiscale Cancer Modeling”, published in 2010/2011 (https://www.routledge.com/Multiscale-Cancer-Modeling/DeisboeckStamatakos/p/book/9781032919249). The textbook is grounded in the lectures of the First Transatlantic Workshop on Multiscale Cancer Modeling. In silico oncology is one of the book's highlights. He introduced the world's first university course on in silico medicine at NTUA (ECE) in 2014 [2]. He has been teaching the course ever since. The "Multiscale Cancer Modeling" textbook is used in the course extensively. He published the "History of the Emergence of In Silico Medicine", using independently verified text produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) in 2025 [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18328392]. G. Stamatakos and the ISO&ISM_G, which he directs, have had a highly fruitful collaboration with 26 outstanding medical schools and medical centres/hospitals across the globe [2].

Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (DDPCR), a detection method that can perform absolute quantification of genes. The study aimed to diagnose PoRV infection using a probe-based DDPCR. 10 2-day-old piglets with mild diarrhea were obtained from a commercial pig farm. No PoRV was detected in the anal swab using colloidal gold test strips. To verify the results of the colloidal gold test strips, RT-qPCR was performed, which identified PoRV in six piglets. Given the limited sensitivity of colloidal gold test strips and RT-qPCR, we developed a DDPCR assay targeting the PoRV Vp4 gene for enhanced detection. The DDPCR assay demonstrated optimal performance at a primer:probe concentration of 400:400 nM and an annealing temperature of 57 °C. It achieved a minimum detection limit of 0.21 copies/μL, the detection sensitivity has been enhanced by 100 times compared to RT-qPCR. Using the established DDPCR detection method, the four samples that tested negative by RT-qPCR were re-tested, and all were found to be PoRV-positive, indicating that the sensitivity of DDPCR was higher than that of RT-qPCR. This study highlights its potential as a valuable tool for early clinical diagnosis and disease control in piglets.</p></details> |  |

It is shown that the use of simplified or empirical methods without proper engineering verification, which is common among car enthusiasts and in small-scale production, can lead to significant deviations in the dynamic characteristics of a vehicle. Such deviations adversely affect stability, handling, ride comfort, and braking efficiency, thereby increasing the risk of road traffic accidents. The study considers basic physical and mathematical models of suspension system operation, in particular the quarter-car model, which makes it possible to assess the influence of spring stiffness, damping coefficient, and tire stiffness on the vertical vibrations of the vehicle body and wheel. The consequences of neglecting these parameters during informal interventions in suspension design are analyzed. An original D3A road safety documentary analysis methodology (Documentation Layer, Data Layer, Delta Analysis) is proposed. This methodology integrates the analysis of technical documentation, digital operational data, and a comparative assessment of deviations in key parameters. The approach is tested using a case study of a Volkswagen Golf V passenger car after an informal modification of the front suspension components. The results indicate a significant increase in vibration decay time, natural frequency, and vertical body acceleration, which confirms a mismatch between spring stiffness and damping characteristics. The proposed methodology enables the identification of potentially hazardous suspension modifications under conditions of limited engineering support and can be applied by vehicle owners, automotive service providers, and technical auditors to improve road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete-Event Simulation for Waste Minimization and Productivity Enhancement in Coupling Manufacturing](https://doi.org/10.3390/app16041701)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving operational excellence in metalworking industries demands tools that accurately model complex production dynamics and guide improvement strategies. This study applies a discrete-event simulation (DES) framework to optimize productivity and reduce steel waste in coupling manufacturing for oil pipeline applications. A six-phase methodology was implemented, covering system characterization, conceptual modeling, statistical data fitting, Python-based simulation, model verification and validation, and experimental scenario analysis. Four improvement scenarios, preventive maintenance, operator training, material quality control, and integrated optimization, were evaluated through ANOVA. Results show that the integrated scenario increased throughput by 14.5%, improved OEE by 8.6%, reduced scrap generation by 35.4%, and shortened lead time by 11.5% compared with the base model. The validated DES model achieved less than 5% deviation from actual plant data, confirming its precision and reliability. The study establishes DES as a robust decision-support tool for industrial optimization and sustainable waste reduction. Future research should integrate real-time data and digital twin architectures to enable adaptive improvement in smart manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel framework that combines blockchain technology with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure and privacy-preserving identity verification during SIM registration. The proposed system allows users to authenticate their identity attributes without revealing any personal information, effectively minimizing direct data access by MNOs or intermediaries. A smart contract deployed on the blockchain enforces regulatory policies while ensuring the transparency, immutability, and auditability of all registration events. By removing single points of failure and minimizing trust in centralized authorities, this work offers a cryptographically secure and regulation-compliant solution, with scalability supported by its modular design for next-generation digital identity management in telecommunications infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Beyond asymptotic security, the feasibility of PQC deployments depends on measured performance on real hardware and on implementation-level overheads. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of five post-quantum digital signature schemes (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, HAWK, SQISign, SNOVA, and SPHINCS+) and three key encapsulation mechanisms (Kyber, HQC, and BIKE) selected to cover multiple PQC design families and parameterizations used in practice. We implement a TCP client–server testbed in Python that invokes C implementations for each primitive—via standalone executables and, where provided, in-process dynamic libraries—and benchmarks key generation, encapsulation/decapsulation, and signature generation/verification on two Windows 11 commodity processors: an AMD Ryzen 7 4000 (8 cores, 16 threads, 1.8 GHz) and an Intel Core i5-1035G1 (4 cores, 8 threads, 1.0 GHz). Each operation is repeated ten times under a low-interference setup, and results are aggregated as mean (with 95% confidence intervals) timings over repeated runs. Across the evaluated configurations, lattice-based schemes (Kyber, Dilithium, HAWK) show the lowest computational cost, while code-based KEMs (HQC, BIKE), isogeny-based (SQISign), and multivariate (SNOVA) signatures incur higher overhead. Hash-based SPHINCS+ exhibits larger artifacts and higher signing latency depending on the parameterization. The AMD platform consistently outperforms the Intel platform, illustrating the impact of CPU characteristics on observed PQC overheads. These results provide comparative evidence to support primitive selection and capacity planning for quantum-resistant deployments, while motivating future end-to-end validation in protocol and web service settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Al in Direct Tax Administration: From Scrutiny to Smart Compliance](https://doi.org/10.55041/ijsrem56439)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ABSTRACT The rapid expansion of digital transactions and the increasing complexity of financial data have placed significant pressure on traditional systems of direct tax administration. Conventional scrutiny-based mechanisms, which rely heavily on manual verification and post-filing enforcement, often result in administrative inefficiencies, prolonged assessment cycles, and rising tax litigation. In response, tax authorities across the world, including India, have increasingly adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) to modernize tax administration and promote efficient compliance management. This paper examines the role of AI in transforming direct tax administration, with specific emphasis on the transition from traditional scrutiny to smart compliance frameworks. The study analyses key AI applications such as risk-based case selection, automated return processing, faceless assessment systems, fraud and tax evasion detection, and AI-enabled taxpayer support services within the Indian income tax system. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning models, tax authorities are increasingly able to shift from reactive enforcement to proactive and preventive compliance strategies. The study further evaluates the impact of AI adoption on administrative efficiency, transparency, taxpayer trust, and revenue outcomes. While AI-driven systems reduce human discretion and enhance consistency in decision-making, they also raise critical concerns related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and legal accountability. The paper concludes that AI has the potential to significantly strengthen direct tax administration and voluntary compliance; however, its effective implementation requires robust governance frameworks, ethical safeguards, and continuous human oversight to ensure fairness and legitimacy.

| **[AI Identification: An Integrated Framework for Sustainable Governance in Digital Enterprises](https://doi.org/10.3390/su18041750)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence (AI) systems grow more powerful, autonomous, and embedded in critical infrastructure, their identification and traceability become foundational to regulatory oversight and sustainable digital governance. In digitally transformed enterprises, long-term sustainability depends on transparent, accountable, and lifecycle-governed AI systems, all of which require verifiable identity. This study proposes a conceptual and architectural framework for AI identification, combining technical and governance mechanisms to support lifecycle accountability. The framework integrates five components: model fingerprinting, cryptographic hashing, blockchain-based registration, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based proof of possession, and post-deployment structural change screening. We introduce a dual-layer identifier, consisting of a machine-verifiable primary hash and a human-readable secondary identifier, anchored in a tamper-resistant registry. Identity validation is supported by selective ZKP-based verification at governance-defined checkpoints, while post-deployment changes are monitored using Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance (LZJD) as a governance-oriented screening signal rather than a semantic performance metric. The framework establishes an enforceable and transparent identity infrastructure that enables continuity, auditability, and policy-aligned oversight across AI system lifecycles. By embedding AI identification within enterprise architecture and governance processes, the proposed approach supports sustainable innovation, strengthens institutional accountability, and provides a foundation for selective, policy-defined verification during digital transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[XOR‐Logic Phase Coding Programmable Metasurface for Low Power‐Consumption Systems](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202521960)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ABSTRACT Programmability greatly enhances the degree of freedom to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves dynamically and lays crucial foundation for intelligent applications of metasurfaces. However, the traditional programmable metasurfaces need complicated biasing networks to control m × n digital meta‐atoms independently to fulfill the reprogrammable functions in real time, which also results in large power consumption to drive the metasurface. To alleviate this problem, we propose an XOR‐logic phase coding programmable metasurface to reduce the complexity of biasing network from m × n to m+n , which can reduce the power consumption significantly. The XOR‐logic phase coding is achieved by path symmetry of surface currents on a Pancharatnam‐Berry meta‐atom loaded with two PIN diodes. By controlling 2× m × n PIN diodes on the whole metasurface in row‐column manner, only m+n biasing lines are required to switch 0 and 1 states of all meta‐atoms independently. As the proof of concept, a prototype of the XOR‐logic phase coding programmable metasurface is designed and fabricated. Both simulation and measured results verify the reprogrammable functions of beam scanning and multi‐beam scattering. This work provides a new type programmable metasurface with simple architecture and low power consumption, which will find wide applications in intelligent systems such as next‐generation wireless communication, Internet of Things, and radar.</p></details> |  |

Examining this process is relevant to understand its scope and challenges within the context of administrative modernization. Objective: To analyze the incidence of electronic invoicing on the efficiency of tax audits in Ecuador, considering its impact on fiscal control, tax compliance, and administrative management. Methodology: A qualitative, documentary, and descriptive design was adopted. Academic, regulatory, and institutional sources published between 2020 and 2024 were reviewed. Of 52 documents identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria and constituted the analyzed corpus. Results: The review shows that electronic invoicing strengthened fiscal control through immediate traceability, automated verification, and large-scale data processing, contributing to the reduction of false invoices and a 22% increase in Income Tax revenue in 2022. Improvements were observed in tax filings and a lower incidence of penalties. In administrative management, cost savings and process optimization were identified, although gaps in training and infrastructure remain. Conclusion: Electronic invoicing improves the efficiency of tax audits; its consolidation requires strengthening technical capacities and institutional support.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Review of Aggregation-Based Colorimetric and SERS Sensing of Metal Ions Utilizing Au/Ag Nanoparticles](https://doi.org/10.3390/bios16020110)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate monitoring and dynamic analysis of metal ions are of considerable practical significance in environmental toxicology and life sciences. Colorimetric analysis and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing technologies, utilizing the aggregation effect of gold and silver nanoparticles (Au/Ag NPs), have emerged as prominent methods for rapid metal ion detection. While sharing a common plasmonic basis, these two techniques serve distinct yet complementary analytical roles: colorimetric assays offer rapid, instrument-free visual screening ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT), whereas SERS provides superior sensitivity and structural fingerprinting for precise quantification in complex matrices. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of these modalities facilitates the development of dual-mode sensing platforms, enabling mutual signal verification for enhanced reliability. This article evaluates contemporary optical sensing methodologies utilizing aggregation effects and their advancements in the detection of diverse metal ions. It comprehensively outlines methodological advancements from nanomaterial fabrication to signal transduction, encompassing approaches such as biomass-mediated green synthesis and functionalization, targeted surface ligand engineering, digital readout systems utilizing intelligent algorithms, and multimodal synergistic sensing. Recent studies demonstrate that these techniques have attained trace-level identification of target ions regarding analytical efficacy, with detection limits generally conforming to or beyond applicable environmental and health safety regulations. Moreover, pertinent research has enhanced detection linear ranges, anti-interference properties, and adaptability for POCT, validating the usefulness and developmental prospects of this technology for analysis in complicated matrices.</p></details> |  |

While such platforms offer opportunities for skill development, teamwork, and social engagement, they also expose minors to heightened risks including cyberbullying, compulsive gaming patterns, psychosocial distress, and adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Competitive dynamics, real-time communication features, and persistent ranking systems may intensify vulnerability among young players, particularly in the absence of robust safety controls and early risk identification mechanisms. This white paper presents a data-informed analysis of child safety risks in online competitive sports gaming, with specific reference to the EA Sports ecosystem. Drawing on public health frameworks, child online safety literature, and verified incident reporting, the paper maps behavioral, physical, mental, and psychosocial harm pathways affecting minors. It further examines how online bullying manifests uniquely within sports gaming environments and proposes measurable indicators for early detection of distress and harmful engagement patterns. Using India as the primary policy context, the paper aligns platform-level responsibilities with existing regulatory instruments, including child data protection and intermediary due-diligence requirements. The study advances a preventive, systems-based framework that integrates product design safeguards, community governance, parental controls, and institutional awareness. Rather than attributing causality to individual incidents, the paper emphasizes risk mitigation, proportional intervention, and wellbeing-centered governance. The findings aim to inform platform developers, policymakers, educational institutions, and guardians seeking to balance digital play with child protection in increasingly competitive online gaming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Digitalisation of Regulatory Compliance in African Pharmaceutical Exports: Bridging the Gap Between Trade and Health Standards](https://osf.io/5sfu8)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ackground: African pharmaceutical markets are rapidly expanding, yet over 70% of medicines consumed in Africa are imported. Regulatory compliance systems across the continent often struggle with limited capacity, leading to prolonged approval times, fragmented standards, and circulation of substandard products. These inefficiencies create a gap between trade ambitions (e.g. export growth under the African Continental Free Trade Area) and health imperatives (ensuring safe, effective medicines). Problem: Siloed trade and health regulatory frameworks have hindered timely access to quality-assured African pharmaceuticals in global markets. Objectives: This study introduces a novel conceptual lens of “digital regulatory harmonization” to examine how digitalisation can bridge regulatory inefficiencies in pharmaceutical trade. We conduct an evidence-anchored secondary analysis of high-impact literature, policy reports (WHO, UNCTAD, Africa CDC), and open datasets to explore: (1) the current compliance challenges in African pharmaceutical exports; (2) digital and AI-enabled solutions for aligning trade and health standards; and (3) the broader epistemological, equity, and civilizational implications of digital trade regulation. Methods: Using a systematic review of 2023–2024 literature and an AI-assisted meta-synthesis of regulatory data, we triangulate case studies (Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa) and quantitative indicators (e.g. approval timelines, regulatory maturity levels) to inform our analysis. Key Findings: African national regulators remain under-resourced—only eight countries have achieved WHO Level 3 maturity (well-functioning regulatory systems), contributing to a pharmaceutical trade deficit that widened from \$2.3 billion in 2000 to \$12.5 billion in 2020. Digital interventions are emerging as game-changers: Mali’s new e-registry slashed medicine approval times from 18 months to 3 months, and Nigeria’s Mobile Authentication Service empowers consumers to verify drug authenticity via SMS. AI-driven analysis suggests that augmenting local regulators with automation and reliance on stringent authorities could boost evaluation capacity by 200–300%. Implications: Philosophical reflection reveals that digitalising compliance is not a mere technical fix but a restructuring of power and knowledge—offering opportunities to democratize access to quality medicines, while raising questions about data sovereignty and technocratic governance. We propose an impact assessment framework to monitor efficiency gains, health outcomes, and equity effects of digital trade regulation. Conclusions: Digitalisation, if guided by robust governance and ethical oversight, can bridge the gap between trade and health standards in Africa’s pharmaceutical sector. It can enable faster access to markets without compromising product safety, thereby supporting both public health and industrial development goals. However, sustained investments, capacity building, and inclusive policy dialogue are critical to ensure that digital regulatory transformation benefits all African nations and safeguards the public interest over the coming decade.</p></details> |  |
| **[Digital Transformation and Its Impact on Developing Quran and Islamic Education Curricula at the Primary Level](https://doi.org/10.48165/sajssh.2026.7104)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research aims to examine the impact of digital transformation on the development of the Quran and Islamic education curricula for primary school students. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted, with the research sample divided into two equal groups: an experimental group that used digital transformation in teaching and a control group that used traditional methods. Research tools included an achievement test to measure memorization, comprehension, and application, and a scale to measure Quranic and religious comprehension and understanding. The validity and reliability of the tools were statistically verified. The results showed a statistically significant advantage for the experimental group in academic achievement and Quranic and religious comprehension, confirming the effectiveness of integrating digital technologies and interactive media in improving student learning and skills. The study also highlighted the importance of training teachers to use technology and providing a supportive learning environment that includes modern digital tools and software. The study concludes that digital transformation represents an effective tool for developing religious curricula and improving educational performance. It emphasizes the need to continue updating digital curricula, supporting infrastructure, and designing digital content that is compatible with Islamic values and the objectives of primary education .</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Assimilation and Modeling Frontiers in Soil–Water Systems](https://doi.org/10.3390/w18040440)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainable soil–water management under climate and socio-economic pressures requires predictive capability that is both mechanistic and continuously corrected by observations. Data assimilation (DA) provides the formal machinery to merge models with heterogeneous measurements—from satellite evapotranspiration and soil moisture to cosmic-ray neutron sensing, proximal geophysics, lysimeters, and groundwater hydrographs—while propagating uncertainty. This review (based on 90 references) synthesizes frontiers in DA and modeling for soil–water systems across scales, emphasizing (i) multi-source observation operators and scaling; (ii) coupled crop–vadose–groundwater modeling frameworks and their structural hypotheses; (iii) modern DA methods (ensemble, variational, particle-based, and hybrid physics–ML) for joint estimation of states, parameters, and biases; and (iv) emerging digital twins that enable predict-then-verify management loops for irrigation, recharge enhancement, and drought risk reduction. We highlight how tracer-aided and isotope-informed components can improve evapotranspiration partitioning and recharge threshold detection, and how agent-based or socio-hydrological coupling can represent human decision feedback. Finally, we outline research gaps in uncertainty quantification, benchmarking, reproducibility, and governance needed to operationalize trustworthy soil–water digital twins for resilient food and water systems.</p></details> |  |

To present and provide a scientific rationale for a comprehensive model of gamified athletics instruction for future martial arts coaches as an innovative instrument for the professionalization of higher sports education. Material and Methods. The methodological framework of the study was based on an integration of theoretical, analytical, and statistical methods. Analysis, synthesis, generalization, and systematization of scholarly sources on gamification, digital technologies, and education were employed. A design-oriented approach and an author-developed questionnaire were used to verify the proposed framework. The study involved 10 academic staff members from higher education institutions specializing in sport sciences. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha), content validity (I-CVI, S-CVI/Ave), and inter-expert agreement (Cohen’s Kappa) were assessed. Results: a comprehensive framework for implementing a gamified approach to teaching athletics to future martial arts coaches in higher education is substantiated. The proposed framework is grounded in self-determination theory, flow theory, and constructivist learning approaches, and emphasizes the interrelationship between motivation, self-regulation, and the development of professional competencies. It integrates motivational mechanics (missions, levels, badges, experience points, quests, and leaderboards) with digital learning environments, learning management systems, mobile applications, and Internet of Things technologies, thereby ensuring formative assessment and continuous monitoring of learning progress. The results of the expert survey indicate an overall positive perception of the proposed framework, with mean values corresponding to moderate to high levels of agreement with the assessed statements. The questionnaire demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0,88) and substantial inter-rater agreement (Cohen’s κ=0,78), confirming its reliability and stability. Overall, the findings suggest that the proposed gamified learning framework is theoretically grounded and methodologically suitable for the initial verification of gamified athletics instruction within the professional training system of future martial arts coaches. Conclusions. The proposed gamification model is a theoretically grounded and methodologically sound tool for improving the quality of professional training of future martial arts coaches. Its implementation is oriented toward fostering intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and the formation of professional identity.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the "wicked problem" of metabolic entropy, OA-1 utilizes a dual-pharmacophore architecture to allosterically inhibit mTORC1 while directly activating AMPK, thereby inducing a potent "Nutrient-Abundance/Metabolic-Repair" paradox. Key highlights of this submission include: High-Affinity Molecular Docking: Simulation results demonstrate a binding affinity of Delta G = -12.4 kcal/mol to the human ATG13-ULK1 complex, significantly exceeding current benchmarks for autophagic induction Temporal Compression: The simulation verifies that OA-1 seeds autophagosomes rapidly, reducing the time to peak autophagy from a standard 12–24 hour fast to approximately 45 minutes post-induction Substrate Autopoiesis: The work proposes a Silicon-Mycelium Bridge, mapping recurrent state-space logic onto the electrochemical spikes of a living fungal network to achieve an antifragile biological-digital interface. Reproducibility Suite: Included is a deterministic Falsification Loop (Python), allowing for the independent verification of docking kinetics and isomorphism rates across diverse phenotypes.

| **[The New Generalized Bernoulli Conservation Law(GBCL): Zero-Sum Dynamics of Gas Vortices and the Geometric Rectification Eigenvalue (pi^2/400)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18505385)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The New Generalized Bernoulli Conservation Law (GBCL): Zero-Sum Dynamics of Gas Vortices and the Geometric Rectification Eigenvalue $\pi^2/400$ Abstract Traditional fluid dynamics often encounters a "missing energy" problem when predicting the limit intensity of severe cyclones, where theoretical values fall short of observations. This paper proposes The New Generalized Bernoulli Conservation Law(GBCL), which incorporates thermodynamic entropy ($S$) as an active term in the fluid differential equation, establishing a total differential zero-sum relationship: $d(\frac{1}{2}v^2) + \frac{dP}{\rho} + T dS = 0$. By substituting the conservation of angular momentum as a kinematic constraint, we reveal that the system is governed by a 2 Degrees of Freedom (2-DOF) geometric rectification mechanism. The energy conversion efficiency is locked by an intrinsic geometric eigenvalue $\eta = 2 \times (\pi^2/400)$. 1. The Paradox of Angular Momentum Initiation A fundamental challenge in atmospheric physics is explaining how a system with zero initial macroscopic angular momentum can evolve into a highly organized, high-velocity vortex without violating conservation laws. In classical models, this transition relies on complex, multi-scale turbulent interactions that are difficult to quantify. Our framework resolves this paradox by demonstrating that the vortex acts as a "Geometric Rectifier." Even when the macroscopic boundary condition starts at $L=0$, the system is immersed in a universal background heat reservoir—a medium of high-entropy, disordered micro-kinetic energy. By coupling the $T dS$ term as an active drive source, the vortex initiation process is revealed to be a selective "harvesting" of this background chaos. The disordered thermal fluctuations are rectified through the 2-DOF manifold, effectively transforming negentropy into ordered tangential momentum. 2. The Geometric Maxwell's Demon and the Entropy Tax To prevent kinetic divergence as the radius shrinks ($r \to 0$), the system must activate a regulatory mechanism. We introduce a reinterpretation of Maxwell's Demon as a geometric constraint rather than a biological or digital agent. This "Geometric Demon" serves as a manifold regulator that manages the energy budget of the vortex. Under this law, nature does not allow free energy conversion. Instead, it imposes a mandatory "Entropy Tax" of 95.06% to sustain the spatial rigidity and structural stability of the vortex manifold. Only a precise fraction—the 4.94% Negentropy Rate—is permitted to be rectified into mechanical wind energy. This ratio is not an empirical fit but is locked by the universal geometric eigenvalue $2 \times (\pi^2/400)$, derived from the symmetry of the 2-DOF system. 3. Quantization and Modal Locking ($N_{mode}=20$) By utilizing the discrete spatial mode $N_{mode}=20$, this model explains the quantized, non-smooth nature of wind speeds observed in extreme storms. Unlike traditional models that predict smooth, continuous transitions, our theory suggests that vortex intensity is governed by "modal locking." This explains why peak wind speeds often cluster around specific energy levels. The $N=20$ mode reflects a stable geometric resonance within the atmospheric fluid, providing a bridge between macro-scale fluid mechanics and the underlying thermodynamic geometry. 4. Scale Invariance and Universal Alignment The significance of the GBCL framework extends beyond meteorology. The identification of $\pi^2/400$ as a fundamental coupling constant establishes a unified mathematical bridge between atmospheric cyclones and galactic-scale dynamics (LGRM). This suggests that the same scale-invariant geometric law governs the rotation of both tropical storms and spiral galaxies. By treating spacetime and fluid manifolds as substantial media with intrinsic rigidity, we provide a "First Principles" solution to the energy gap in both fields, removing the need for dark matter in cosmology and empirical dissipation factors in fluid dynamics. Key Technical Parameters for Data Alignment: Fundamental Equation: $d(\frac{1}{2}v^2) + \frac{dP}{\rho} + T dS = 0$ Geometric Eigenvalue ($\kappa$): $\pi^2/400 \approx 0.02467$ Total Rectification Efficiency ($\eta$): $2\kappa \approx 0.04935$ (4.94%) System Constraint: 2-DOF (Radial/Tangential Coupling) Entropy Tax Rate: 95.06% (Structural Maintenance Cost) [Note: The Mathematical Logic of Ideal Cyclone Negentropy] 1. Conservation of Energy (Zero-Sum Game): In an ideal gas model, the total energy inside and outside the circle must remain equal. For a rotating ring to manifest Rotational Kinetic Energy (expressed as Kinetic Pressure), it must do so at the expense of an equivalent amount of Static Pressure Energy. The Model: P_outer = P_inner + P_kinetic Defining Negentropy: The reduction of static pressure (disordered energy) into kinetic energy (ordered energy) represents the Negentropy Transformation. 2. Mechanical Equilibrium (The Price of Structure): For the circle to remain stable (neither expanding nor collapsing), a pressure balance must be achieved. The outer static pressure pushes inward, while the internal centrifugal pressure pushes outward. Equilibrium Condition: P_outer = P_inner + P_centrifugal Structural Support: The Centrifugal Pressure (P_centrifugal), generated by the kinetic energy, is the sole pillar maintaining this pressure differential. 3. Negentropy Efficiency (Transformation Rate): Why does the entropy decrease inside the circle? Because the system is forced to "align" a portion of its energy into rotation to generate the Centrifugal Pressure required to withstand the external pressure. The Transformation Rate: Readers can verify the specific ratio of energy that must be locked into motion to maintain this balance. The Constant: η = 2 * (π^2 / 400) ≈ 0.04935 Conclusion: This locked ratio defines the Negentropy Transformation Efficiency of the cyclonic structure. Summary for the Reader: Negentropy is not created from nothing; it is the "Order Tax" the system must pay to generate centrifugal force and prevent being crushed by the external environment. Formal Definition: The Principle of Geometric Precedence Definition: The Causal Hierarchy of Geometry and Matter 1. Geometric Rigidity as the Primary Cause The geometric structure of spacetime—defined fundamentally by $\pi$ and the rectification constant $\eta$—exists as an a priori physical boundary. It remains immutable regardless of the presence of matter and acts as a "Mandatory Constraint" upon all material motion. 2. Material Dynamics as the Secondary Effect The observable physical attributes of matter (such as pressure distribution, density, and rotational velocity) are merely "Adaptive Solutions" generated by the system to satisfy these geometric constraints. Matter does not dictate the geometry; it conforms to it. 3. The Essence of GBCL The Generalized Bernoulli Conservation Law (GBCL) does not describe how matter creates energy. Instead, it describes a thermodynamic trade-off: how matter sacrifices specific degrees of freedom (entropy) in exchange for structural stability (survival) within the confines of geometric rigidity.</p></details> |  |

It also supports typed failure diagnosis (semantic, causal, embodiment and out-of-scope), feasibility across robots and environments, and counterfactual reasoning about robot body motions.

| **[Photonic neural networks for signal equalization in optical fiber transmission](https://hdl.handle.net/11572/473471)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical fibers represent the backbone of the telecommunication infrastructure, providing for long-distance transmission at large bandwidths. The massive use of the Internet in modern society, however, generates an unprecedented traffic demand, pushing research towards new solutions that adapt to different scenarios and costs. This involves an evolution in optical transceivers, which are modules responsible for the transmission and reception of optical signals in fiber. The implementation of higher modulation frequencies, complex modulation formats, and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing increases the transmitted bandwidth, but simultaneously worsens linear and nonlinear effects accumulated during fiber propagation. These create distortions in the propagated sequence, introducing the need for recovering its integrity after the transmission, operating an equalization process. Nowadays, this is mainly provided at the transceiver level via Digital Signal Processing, requiring huge computational effort, power consumption, and latency. In this work, I explore the use of an integrated photonic neural network for efficient signal equalization in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection links. The device under test implements an 8-tap time-delayed complex perceptron equipped with tunable amplitude and phase weights on each tap. These determine the optical response of the device and are optimized to provide equalization in various transmission scenarios. Contrary to electronics-based solutions, signal processing is operated entirely in the optical domain, thus minimizing latency and power consumption. The device is realized in a Silicon photonic platform, thus compatible with standard CMOS processes for reduced unit cost in mass production. Its small footprint makes it suitable for scalability and integration in the next-generation transceivers. This design is experimentally tested against Chromatic Dispersion and Self-Phase modulation in 10 Gbaud Pulse amplitude-modulated signals. The training is performed offline by maximizing the eye diagram aperture, verifying the equalization in single- and multi-span links. Simulations allowed studying the scalability of the device to 100G applications, adapting the existing layouts and testing new architectures for future implementations. A comparison with the current state-of-the-art reveals the promising benefits introduced by the proposed all-optical approach, encouraging further steps towards photonic implementations for telecom.</p></details> |  |

Whether you’re a digital marketer running multiple campaigns, a data analyst scraping web data, an affiliate manager juggling region-restricted offers, or an everyday user who values online anonymity—mobile proxies are indispensable tools that empower your online presence. And now, with the Mobile Proxies Coupon Code 2026: (EzC-yp7-huM-zYn) you can get 20% off on mobile proxy services, making advanced web access more affordable and accessible. This comprehensive article will guide you through everything you need to know about mobile proxies, how they work, why they matter in 2026, key use cases, how to apply your coupon code, and tips for choosing the best provider. As more services tighten geo-restrictions, block bots, and enforce CAPTCHA challenges, traditional proxies often fall short. Mobile proxies, operating through real mobile networks, offer unmatched legitimacy and access, bypassing blocks that would stop standard datacenter IPs in their tracks. With this coupon code, you’ll receive a 20% discount on subscription plans—making it an excellent opportunity to upgrade your proxy strategy at significant savings. What Are Mobile Proxies? Mobile proxies are intermediary servers that route your internet requests through real mobile devices on cellular networks. Unlike datacenter proxies, which use IP addresses assigned to servers, mobile proxies appear as genuine mobile users, making them extremely effective at mimicking human behavior online. This means when you use a mobile proxy: Your web requests appear to come from a real mobile device. You get an IP address assigned by a mobile carrier. You can access websites and services that typically block datacenter IPs. You reduce the risk of bans when scraping or managing accounts. In simple terms, mobile proxies act as a shield between your device and the web while providing authenticity that helps you access more content with fewer restrictions. Why Mobile Proxies Matter in 2026 The digital world moves fast, and web platforms are becoming smarter in detecting automated access. From retail giants cracking down on bot traffic to social media platforms flagging suspicious accounts, challenges abound. Mobile proxies solve many of these issues because they blend into everyday internet traffic. By 2026, mobile proxies have become essential for: High-volume data collection where traditional proxies fail. Social media management spanning multiple accounts and regions. Ad verification and competitive analysis across markets. Accessing region-locked web content for testing, research, and marketing. Protecting user privacy and identity online. With their real-world IP authenticity and dynamic rotation features, mobile proxies are no longer optional—they’re strategic assets. How Mobile Proxies Work Mobile proxies bridge your internet connection and the target server. Here’s a breakdown of how they function: Real Mobile Network Assignment When you connect through a mobile proxy, your traffic is routed through an IP address assigned by a cellular network provider. This makes your connection look like normal user traffic to the destination server. Dynamic IP Rotation Mobile proxies often rotate IP addresses automatically. This feature helps avoid blocks and allows you to make multiple requests without triggering security systems. Invisible to Traditional Blocks Because mobile proxies use genuine mobile carrier IPs, websites and services are less likely to flag them as suspicious. This is crucial for bypassing bot protections, CAPTCHA, or rate limits. Key Features to Look for in Mobile Proxy Services Not all mobile proxy providers are created equal. Here are important features to consider when choosing a provider, especially when using the Mobile Proxies Coupon Code 2026: (EzC-yp7-huM-zYn) to get 20% off: Large IP Pool A bigger pool of mobile IPs gives you greater diversity and minimizes the likelihood of blocks or restrictions. Automatic Rotation Automatic IP rotation saves time and enables large-scale operations without manual intervention. Global Locations Access to IPs from different countries helps you test, verify, and access geographically restricted content. High Uptime and Reliability Look for services that guarantee stable connections and minimal downtime for seamless operations. User-friendly Dashboard A clean control panel with easy-to-manage settings makes a big difference, especially for beginners. Popular Use Cases for Mobile Proxies Mobile proxies can be applied in a variety of scenarios across industries and tasks. Below are the most common and impactful use cases in 2026. Web Scraping and Data Collection For reliable data extraction from websites, mobile proxies help bypass IP blocks and bot detection systems. This is critical for market research, pricing intelligence, and competitive analysis. Social Media Management Managing multiple social media profiles often triggers security alerts if done from the same IP address. Mobile proxies provide unique IPs that reduce the risk of account restrictions. Ad Verification and Monitoring Marketers and agencies use mobile proxies to ensure ads are displayed correctly in different regions and detect fraudulent ads or misplacement. E-Commerce and Sneaker Bots Mobile proxies help users purchase limited-release items or manage multiple e-commerce accounts without being blocked by retailers’ bot detection systems. Localized Testing and Geo-Targeting Developers and marketers who need to test experiences from specific regions use mobile proxies to emulate real user traffic from target locations. Enhanced Privacy and Security Mobile proxies add a layer of anonymity, protecting your identity and preventing websites from tracking your actual IP address. Applying the Mobile Proxies Coupon Code 2026 (EzC-yp7-huM-zYn) Using your coupon code is straightforward and designed to help you save on powerful proxy solutions: Choose a Mobile Proxy Subscription: Select the plan that best suits your need—monthly, quarterly, or annual. Enter Coupon Code: Input EzC-yp7-huM-zYn in the discount or promo code field. Enjoy 20% Off: Your total cost will be reduced, giving you greater value. Whether you’re upgrading to a high-capacity plan or trying mobile proxies for the first time, this coupon code provides meaningful savings. Benefits of Using Mobile Proxies with a Discount Significant Cost Savings Getting 20% off makes advanced proxy services more affordable, especially for professionals who use them regularly. Access to Premium Features Higher-tier plans often include features such as larger IP pools, priority support, and global location coverage. A discount helps you upgrade without the premium price tag. Scalability With savings in place, you might afford a larger plan that supports more tasks, more users, or more operations simultaneously. Enhanced Performance With a better plan enabled by your discount, you minimize disruptions and maximize efficiency in data scraping, social media, or other applications. Comparing Mobile Proxies to Other Proxy Types Understanding the differences between proxy categories helps you make smarter choices. Datacenter Proxies Pros: Affordable and fast. Cons: Easily identifiable by websites and often blocked. Residential Proxies Pros: Appear as real home users. Cons: Limited in scale; can be flagged if many requests come from a single IP block. Mobile Proxies Pros: Genuine mobile carrier IPs, less likely to be flagged, reliable for high-volume tasks. Cons: Slightly more expensive than datacenter proxies, but worth the investment. In many advanced use cases, mobile proxies strike the perfect balance between legitimacy and performance. Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Mobile Proxy Subscription Here are smart strategies to ensure you fully leverage your mobile proxy service: Plan According to Your Needs If your tasks are intensive, consider a plan with a broader IP pool and faster rotation. The coupon code makes upgrading more affordable. Use IP Rotation Wisely Automate IP rotation to avoid blocks and reduce manual intervention. Monitor Usage and Performance Track which IPs perform best and adjust your setups accordingly to optimize efficiency. Ensure Compliance Always use proxies responsibly. Respect robots.txt rules and terms of service for sites you interact with. Combine with Other Tools For advanced workflows, integrate proxies with scraping frameworks, automation tools, or social media management platforms. Common Misconceptions About Mobile Proxies With the rise in demand, some myths have also emerged. Here’s the truth behind common misconceptions: Mobile Proxies Are Only for Hackers False. While any tool can be misused, mobile proxies are legitimate tools used by businesses, marketers, developers, and security teams. They’re Too Expensive Thanks to offers like the Mobile Proxies Coupon Code 2026: (EzC-yp7-huM-zYn) with 20% off, many high-quality plans become cost-effective. All Providers Are the Same Not true. Providers vary in terms of IP pool size, location diversity, speed, support, and uptime reliability. Choose wisely. Real-World Examples of Mobile Proxy Usage Example 1: Global Price Monitoring A retail company uses mobile proxies to monitor product prices across regions without getting blocked or flagged, providing real-time pricing insights. Example 2: Social Media Growth A social media agency manages dozens of accounts across platforms and regions. Using mobile proxies ensures accounts remain safe and accessible. Example 3: Competitive SEO Tracking An SEO analyst uses mobile proxies to track search engine rankings from multiple regions, ensuring accurate data for clien</p></details> |  |

Using the ancient Luoshu (3×3 magic square) as a blueprint, we propose a self-consistent cosmological framework: **I. Origin: The Light Dragon Enters the Net, Spacetime is Born** The universe begins as an absolutely static nine-dimensional light sphere ("Dimensional State"). At the moment of "Rupture-Change," the sphere transforms into countless "energy particles" in spiral motion, plunging into an infinitely extending "Luoshu Digital Grid." The **grid points** constitute our three-dimensional world (Yang side), while the **holes** represent hidden dimensions (Yin side). Particles shuttle at high speed between Yin and Yang—what we observe as an "electron cloud" is merely snapshots of their occasional "appearances" at the grid points. **Time** is the phase flow of the spiral, and **space** is the relative positional network of the particles—the only entity in the universe is the energy particles themselves in spiral motion. **II. Particles: Mass Determined by Genetic Inheritance and Relational Weaving** Each particle is assigned a "Digital Root" (1-9), its **innate genetic code**, which determines the tightness of its spiral: the tighter it is, the greater the "bending potential energy" required to maintain its shape, and thus the higher its **intrinsic mass**. Particles interact via "affinity forces" on the Luoshu grid, generating **relational mass**. Therefore, a particle's total mass = **Intrinsic (Genetic)** + **Relational (Weaving)**. This framework naturally sorts the numbers 1-9 into three families: leptons (1,4,7), quarks (2,5,8), and bosons (3,6,9). **III. Forces: The Dance and Deformation on the Grid** The four fundamental forces are different manifestations of the same "weaving dance": strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces correspond to horizontal pulling and resonance among particles on the grid; **gravity is not a fundamental force** but the macroscopic manifestation of the collective "stomping deformation" of the grid caused by the spiral motion of all particles. **IV. v8.0: From Pursuing Precision to Constructing a Framework** This version (v8.0) is a systematic reconstruction and deepening of the previous v7.0. While v7.0 attempted to provide a fully quantitative mass formula, subsequent verification revealed computational inaccuracies, making it difficult to perfectly fit the entire particle mass spectrum. Therefore, v8.0 makes a crucial shift: **it no longer seeks to immediately provide precise fitted numerical values but instead focuses on constructing a complete, self-consistent, and fully parameterized framework where all constants are derived from Luoshu geometry.** We retain and strengthen the core insights from v7.0 (such as the Trinity, even-multiple spacing principle, and digital root classification), while:1. **Clarifying the dual-axis model** (vertical fractal projection and horizontal neighborhood weaving);2. **Completely geometrizing all constants** (e.g., the golden ratio φ emerges naturally as the product of the structural compression ratio and information reduction rate);3. **Quantifying the Yin-Yang oscillation mechanism**, linking quantum probability to geometric weight;4. **Proposing a unified spiral dynamics equation** (ELSS equation) providing a field-theoretic foundation for interactions. **V. Testable Predictions** This theory is not merely a mathematical exercise; it offers clear experimental targets: **Digital Root Conservation** (the sum of digital roots modulo 9 remains constant in all reactions), **Material-Dependent Micron-Scale Gravity**, and **Mod-9 Modulation in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation**. These predictions provide a clear path for falsification and further development of the theory. This paper aims to provide a self-consistent cosmological **framework and blueprint** based on digital geometry. The specific parameter fitting and numerical refinement are left for future scientific work. We believe it offers an inspiring new paradigm for contemplating particle physics, quantum gravity, and the origin of the universe. **Keywords**: Luoshu; Digital Geometry; Spiral Weaving; Mass Origin (Genetic-Relational); Yin-Yang Oscillation; Stomping Gravity; Unified Field Theory</p></details> |  |
| **[How Parents Shape Adolescent Screen Time: Findings from Denmark and Ireland](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6n4fc_v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Parents may influence adolescents’ screen time both through their own digital behaviours and through explicit screen time rules. However, evidence remains limited as to the relative strength of these mechanisms and whether they operate similarly across family and national contexts. This paper fills this gap and compares empirical results from two European contexts - Ireland and Denmark. Methods: The study draws on two closely aligned datasets collected during similar time periods among comparably aged adolescents. For Denmark, data collected in 2023 from children aged 8–15 years and their parents is analysed, combining self-reported social media use with objective, screenshot-verified usage data (n = 1,025 parent–child pairs; n = 352 with objective data). For Ireland, cohort data collected in 2021/22 is examined, in which parents report both their own and their child’s general screen use and digital rule-setting practices at age 13 (n = 4,424). In both countries, screen time is captured using harmonised ordinal categories. Associations are estimated between adolescent screen time, parental screen habits, rule-setting behaviours, and demographic covariates.Results: In both countries, maternal and paternal screen habits were associated with adolescent screen time, although maternal behaviour had a stronger predictive value in Ireland. Across contexts, the presence of parental rules was modestly linked to lower screen use, but screen time modelling appeared to be more influential. The observed associations between maternal and children’s self-reported social media usage were consistent with those obtained using objective screen time data.Conclusion: Across two distinct national contexts, parental screen habits emerged as a consistent and robust predictor of adolescent digital engagement, frequently demonstrating a stronger association than explicit rule-setting. Although parental restrictions were modestly linked to reduced screen use, behavioural modelling appears to be the primary pathway through which parents influence their children's digital habits. These findings provide empirical support for theoretical frameworks regarding the role of observed parental practice and direct regulation. Consequently, policy interventions and clinical guidance could focus on promoting healthier digital modelling within the family unit to more effectively shape adolescent screen behaviours.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Madrasahs Build Students’ Character in Indonesia's Society 5.0 Era: Emerging Challenges](https://doi.org/10.31538/nzh.v9i1.412)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to analyze how madrasas develop students' character in the Society 5.0 era and to identify the various challenges and strategies implemented to strengthen moral values amid technological disruption. Using a qualitative case study approach, the research was conducted across three levels of madrasah education: Ibtidaiyyah, Tsanawiyah, and Aliyah. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with three madrasah principals, three deputy heads of curriculum who also serve as teachers, students, and parents, complemented by participant observation and document analysis. Data analysis followed the stages of data reduction, data display, and verification. The findings reveal that character education challenges in madrasahs are multidimensional, encompassing technological, social, cultural, and institutional factors. In response, madrasahs implement holistic and integrative strategies, including strengthening religious foundations, transforming Islamic values into social ethics, integrating local wisdom, developing character-based digital literacy, and fostering synergy among teachers, families, and communities. These strategies demonstrate that madrasahs operationalize SDG 4.7 by promoting ethical digital citizenship, moral responsibility, and humanistic values within a technology-driven learning environment. This study contributes to theory by expanding the understanding of how Islamic educational institutions contextualize global frameworks such as Society 5.0 and SDG 4 within local religious and cultural settings. In practice, the findings provide policy-relevant insights for educators and policymakers in designing adaptive, values-based character education models that support sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality education in the digital age.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Policy Alignment to Digital Trust: Revitalizing the TuCAHEA Legacy in Central Asian Higher Education via Blockchain and AI](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202602.0395.v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dissolution of the Soviet Union fractured the once-unified educational space of Central Asia, creating severe barriers to student mobility and qualification recognition that persist despite decades of reform. While the EU-funded TuCAHEA project (2012–2015) successfully introduced the "Tuning" methodology to align competence frameworks semantically, this study argues that regional integration has since stalled due to a critical "Implementation Gap." Through a combination of historical policy analysis and Design Science Research (DSR), this paper identifies that the stagnation stems from an infrastructural deficit: the lack of a secure mechanism to operationalize trust in a region characterized by high bureaucratic friction and strict data sovereignty laws. To address this, we propose the "Digital CAHEA" framework, a novel socio-technical architecture designed to transition the region from fragile "soft trust" agreements to robust "algorithmic trust." Specifically, we design a two-layer infrastructure: a Consortium Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) to enable immutable, offline-capable credential verification without storing personal data on-chain, and a Federated Learning layer to facilitate regional quality assurance analytics while complying with rigid national data localization mandates. By bridging the gap between higher education policy and distributed ledger technology, this research offers a scalable, sovereignty-preserving roadmap to revitalize the dormant potential of the Central Asian Higher Education Area.</p></details> |  |

| **[Exploration and Practice of Transforming Pilot-Scale R&amp;D Achievements into Teaching Projects in Higher Vocational Colleges](https://doi.org/10.22158/wjer.v13n1p136)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under the policy orientation of the high-end and intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry and the integration of production and education, pilot-scale R&amp;D achievements, as key intermediate products of technology industrialization, possess both technological innovation and practical applicability, which are highly consistent with the training objectives for technical and skilled talents in higher vocational colleges. Based on literature research and practical exploration, this paper sorts out the core value and existing dilemmas of transforming pilot-scale achievements, constructs a full-chain transformation path including three-dimensional screening, four-step reconstruction, school-enterprise collaboration, and multi-dimensional evaluation, and verifies the feasibility of the path with cases in fields such as industrial robots, intelligent production lines, and digital twins. The research shows that this transformation mode can effectively solve the problems of backward teaching resources and disconnection between production and education in higher vocational education, providing practical reference for improving talent training quality and deepening school-enterprise cooperation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event Ticket Booking with QR Code Validation Using Spring Boot and RESTful Architecture](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18506170)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event Ticket Booking with QR Code Validation is a web-based application designed to provide a secure, efficient, and user- friendly solution for managing event ticketing processes online. The system enables users to browse available events, book tickets, and receive digitally generated tickets in the form of unique QR codes for entry verification. By automating ticket booking and validation, the application reduces manual effort and minimizes errors associated with traditional ticketing methods. The system is developed using modern full-stack web technologies, with React.js used for the frontend to deliver a responsive user interface, Spring Boot used for backend services to handle business logic, and MySQL used for reliable data storage and management. The application is structured into two primary modules: User Module and Admin Module. The User Module allows users to register, authenticate, view events, book tickets, and access their booked tickets through QR codes. The Admin Module enables administrators to manage events, monitor ticket bookings, and validate tickets by scanning QR codes at event entry points. Each ticket generated by the system contains a unique QR code to ensure secure and accurate verification. Once scanned, the system validates the ticket and updates its status to prevent duplicate usage, thereby reducing ticket fraud. The application communicates through RESTful APIs to support real-time booking and validation while maintaining secure authentication and role- based access control. Overall, this project demonstrates an effective full-stack approach for building a scalable, secure, and reliable digital event ticketing system suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Development of an AI-based modular system for automated assessment and adaptive learning in higher school](https://doi.org/10.51707/2618-0529-2025-34-02)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing complexity of educational demands and the expansion of digital learning environments have underscored the need for intelligent automation in teaching and assessment processes. Traditional educational platforms often lack adaptability, resulting in limited personalization and increased workload for educators. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into learning systems presents a promising avenue for addressing these challenges by enhancing scalability, efficiency, and individualized instruction. This study aimed to improve the quality and efficiency of the educational process by developing and implementing an AI-powered automated system for generating, verifying, and analyzing educational control tasks. The system was designed to support personalized learning, streamline assessment, and reduce the burden of routine academic activities. The proposed solution is built on a modular architecture using contemporary web technologies (React, Next.js, Firebase) in combination with the GPT model API. The system includes modules for test generation, automated answer checking, a conversational AI assistant, performance analytics, and real-time feedback. Document processing capabilities (DOCX, PDF) and seamless integration with Google Forms are also incorporated. The system’s performance was evaluated based on assessment accuracy, time savings, and usability. Implementation results indicate high effectiveness of the system in real educational scenarios. The automated evaluation module achieved an accuracy rate of 80–96 %, closely aligning with manual grading benchmarks. Additionally, the time required to prepare instructional content and assessments was reduced by 60–80 %. The user interface enabled intuitive access to system functionalities, and the adaptive features provided a personalized experience for students of varying proficiency levels. The developed system demonstrates significant potential for transforming educational practices through AI integration. It enhances personalization, reduces educator workload, and improves the consistency and objectivity of assessments. Future research will focus on expanding system functionality, including support for multimodal learning and large-scale institutional deployment.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cross-Border Digital Identity System Based on Ethereum Layer 2 Architecture](https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics15030708)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern passport systems face significant challenges in secure data sharing, real-time verification, and user-controlled authorization, particularly in cross-border scenarios. Existing digital passport solutions, often built on permissioned blockchains, suffer from limited transparency, scalability, and high operational costs. This paper proposes a decentralized passport management system based on an Ethereum Layer 2 architecture that combines global governance with high-throughput and cost-efficient passport operations. The system adopts a hybrid design in which a Global Passport Registry smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet for cross-country coordination, while passport issuance, access control, and identity management are handled on Layer 2 networks through country-operated Passport Managers and user-specific Personal Passport smart contracts. Extensive performance evaluations show that Ethereum Layer 1 throughput saturates at approximately 40–50 transactions per second (TPS), whereas the proposed Layer 2 deployment consistently exceeds 150 TPS and reaches up to 300 TPS under higher-performance environments, significantly surpassing the estimated system requirement of 70 TPS. These improvements result in faster response times, reduced congestion, and substantially lower transaction costs, demonstrating that public Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructures can effectively support a scalable, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and globally verifiable digital passport system suitable for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

The record formalizes a domain-agnostic approach to post-export, pre-archive verification, applicable across clinical trials, audit and assurance, AI governance, cloud integrity, and long-term regulated evidence retention. Verification is performed using deterministic, hash-only comparison of canonical evidence states (Tₖ vs Tₙ), with optional decentralized time attestation and public blockchain anchoring. No raw evidence, identifiers, or personal data are disclosed. The methodology produces one of two deterministic outcomes: (i) Proof-of-Unchanged (PASS), confirming byte-level equivalence between evidence states; or (ii) divergence enumeration, identifying byte-level or membership-level differences to bound proportional human review. Divergence outcomes are informational and do not imply error, non-compliance, or misconduct. Proof-of-Unchanged is applied at custody boundaries, not within source systems, and does not require integration with operational platforms. It detects change rather than preventing it, and preserves evidentiary continuity across legitimate transformations by establishing new canonical states following verified SOP-driven modifications. This record is published as a public methodology document, supported by cryptographically anchored execution evidence and regulatory mapping described in C12 – AuditLog.AI Global Compliance Matrix. It does not assert regulatory approval or classification, and is intended to support independent evaluation, inspection readiness, and reproducibility assessment.

EHT is built on an elliptic-curve–based partial homomorphic encryption scheme (EC-ElGamal) and extends it with verifiable digital signatures (EHDSA) and zero-knowledge policy proofs (zk-FIDNA), enabling both confidentiality and integrity in distributed execution environments.Unlike lattice-based fully homomorphic encryption, which suffers from high computational cost and ciphertext expansion, EHT preserves constant-size ciphertexts and achieves O(1) amortized complexity per operation, allowing real-time encrypted computation even in large-scale systems. The proposed four-layer architecture separates cryptographic primitives from domain-specific semantics, enabling seamless interoperability across heterogeneous applications such as encrypted databases, federated learning, web authentication, and blockchain transaction networks.Through its tokenized abstraction, EHT allows operations—query execution, aggregation, verification—to be performed directly on ciphertexts while maintaining verifiability through EHDSA and zk-FIDNA proofs.Experimental results demonstrate sub-millisecond elliptic-curve operations, achieving over 8,000 homomorphic additions per second on commodity hardware with less than 2% overhead relative to baseline elliptic-curve performance. EHT thus represents a cryptographically lightweight yet distributedly scalable homomorphic framework: compact enough for real-time use, verifiable enough for regulatory and enterprise environments, and extensible enough to support post-quantum and cross-domain adaptations. By unifying encryption, verification, and computation into a single token-based execution model, EHT advances the state of privacy-preserving technology toward a truly encrypted, interoperable, and verifiable computation fabric.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Conceptual Framework for Sustainable Pollution Control in Informal Economies with Generative AI](https://doi.org/10.3390/su18031703)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intangible environmental externalities in informal economies are hard to detect, attribute, and regulate because transaction records and evidentiary trails are fragmented. This conceptual paper reframes pollution control from improving model performance to designing institutions for verifiability and examines how generative AI (GAI) can both strengthen and undermine that verifiability. Integrating transaction-structure theory, institutional economics, and digital-governance research, we derive four propositions: (P1) standardized, interoperable evidence and hybrid auditing allow GAI to lower verification costs; (P2) opaque, multi-tier transactions and concentrated data control enable plausible falsification; (P3) detection reduces pollution only when linked to remediation through enforcement capacity; and (P4) incentives must reward verified, not merely claimed, circularity to deter greenwashing. We illustrate feasibility and boundary conditions through three precedents: Amazon’s unit-level identifiers and sustainability labeling, India’s CPCB extended producer responsibility portal for plastic packaging, and Brazil’s nationwide e-invoicing infrastructure (NF-e/SPED). The framework offers actionable design principles, testable hypotheses, and measurable indicators (evidence linkage, audit-log completeness, time-to-remediation) for future empirical work. The framework is intended to support analytic generalization for policy and practice across contexts.</p></details> |  |

| **[Vertical Reuse of Reference Models in UVM](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_143.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—These days the complexity of designs is growing faster than ever. This leads to the requirement of dividing and conquering the verification task in order to cope with  the complexity. Besides formal verification of the individual blocks , random verification is often still required to cover scenarios that cannot be covered formally due to complexity. For the random verification a reference model is required in order to check if the response of the design is in line with the specification.  The Universal Verification Methodology  (UVM) provides concepts to build up a testbench hierarchical to reuse verification environments in a bottom-up divide and conquer verification flow. The vertical reuse of reference models, however, is not really documented in UVM. This paper shows an approach on how the vertical reuse of reference model can be achieved.

Despite their popularity, as of 2023 no open-source simulator supports enough SystemVerilog constructs to allow a complete imple- mentation of UVM, relegating these methodologies to costly closed-source tools. This paper explores using Verilator, a SystemVerilog to SystemC/C++ conversion tool, and Accelera’s UVM-SystemC library to build an industry level open-source verification environment. Finally, a case study is presented in which the proposed framework is used to verify a RISC-V microprocessor, taking full advantage of the features offered by this unique combination of tools and methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

However, on the SoC, typically there are embedded cores in the design under test which are also used to execute verification code . The completion of the UVM life cycle is done using the UVM objections. On the embedded software side, a similar implicit SoC specific life cycle is running. This SoC life cycle is defined for sure by the various resets, but also by functions like e.g. logic BIST, clock ramp, security – just to name few. Further, as there are typically multiple cores on the SoC and they themselves have their independent life cycles, the embedded cores among themself need to be synchronized. The completion control from the tests running on the em bedded cores in junction with the UVM testbench is topic this paper.

| **[UVM Testbench Automation for AMS Designs](downloads/dvcon/1137.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>- In the world of design verification for analog and mixed-signal (AMS) Systems on Chips (SOCs) there are many problems, some of which are now relatively solved.  AMS modeling has converged on Verilog-AMS and SystemVerilog real numbered modeling (SV-RNM), with simulator support available from major electronic design automation (EDA) vendors.  Behavioral model development productivity is supported with tools available from some smaller EDA vendors.  One of the remaining productivity gaps is in testbench automation.  Digital design teams will often have a System-C, transaction level model (TLM) of the digital system under test from which both the RTL and a Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench can be derived, however TLM does not work well as a specification for an analog or mixed-signal system, and UVM is a complicated stretch for the mixed-signal team to adopt.  For smaller digital blocks where C or TLM models exist, or can be developed, as a reference specification, this specification will drive the development of a UVM bench for the block level design.  However, for the equivalent level in the mixed-signal design comprising several circuits working together: an RF synthesizer, radio receiver or transmitter chain, or even an entire radio transceiver with many digital controls but little digital content, no simple and standard way of quickly creating a verification bench exists.  This is where there is a convergence of a lot of activity ─ the system designer, analog lead, creation and update of the top-level schematic, designers need to start working together, and is therefore the place where there is often difficulty and a source for errors.  It is also where circuit simulation is needed and becomes slow and often infeasible.  This is the area that we address.  We propose a standardized testbench architecture based on UVM and show a method to automate the construction of a bench for each design.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

At some instant , there were different competing verification methodologies  and languages such as VMM, AVM and  Vera. VMM mainly relies on the power of scenarios to generate TLM stimuli. Then OVM was developed to be open source which permits cooperation across different EDA providers to improve. OVM was supporting both scenarios and sequences but then it was decided to continue with seque nces as the TLM randomization strategy. UVM has been evolved from OVM and inherits the concept of sequence in turn. While the sequence is playing the main role in UVM verification, it lacks power of scenarios in running multiple sequences in complex random  manner. There was an attempt to include scenarios in UVM but it applies one to one mapping, one sequence runs one scenario.  Also, Portable Stimulus Standard (PSS) is a recent C++ based methodology that aims to generate random UVM tests  based on defining set of possible scenarios. However, it still requires another language to define scenarios and tool to generate the  UVM testcases.  In this paper, a novel approach is developed  in UVM to use multi -stream parallel state scenario adding more complexity in SoC  verification to increase test co verage without additional overhead.  Moreover, it can be exploited by PSS to transfer the verification intent easily using the embedded synchronized schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |
| **[UVM Based Generic Interrupt Service Routine (gISR)](downloads/dvcon/1A1-DVConIndia2025_Final_Paper_4877.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs extensively rely on intricate interrupt mechanisms for event handling. Traditional hardware interrupt verification uses unstandardized, manual, and error-prone methods that are difficult to scale or reuse, especially dealing with complex interrupt aggregation points. This paper introduces a novel, reusable UVM-based framework designed to overcome the aforementioned issues. We present a solution that models interrupts as a hierarchical object tree, featuring a central manager for building these hierarchies and an intelligent monitor that automates runtime source identification, reporting and end-of-simulation checks.

This fragmentation results in redundant development, inconsistent methodologies, and delays in verification cyc les. As projects progress —from directed tests early on to random exploration in the middle and pseudo -random patterns for targeted coverage closure toward the end — maintaining isolated environments becomes inefficient. The proposed solution is  a unified UVM -based testbench that integrates all verification modes into a single configurable environment. By supporting  mode selection through configuration, dynamic layering of sequences, and utilizing a reusable testbench library , this approach reduces overhead, enhances reusability from IP to SoC levels, and streamline s test development throughout the verification lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

A Python-based verification environment capitalizes on open- source frameworks such as PyUVM providing Python-based UVM 1.2 implementation and PyVSC facilitating constrained randomization and functional coverage. These libraries play a pivotal role in expediting test development and hold promise for reducing setup costs. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of PyUVM verification testbenches across various design IPs, aiming for a comprehensive comparison of their features and performance metrics with the established SystemVerilog-UVM methodology. I. I NTRODUCTION With the continuous increase in complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, verification is becoming ever more challenging. As a result, the time required for verification experiences a significant upsurge. Additionally, there is a subsequent need to be more productive and efficient with limited manpower. Industry-utilized methodologies like Constrained Random Verification (CRV), Formal Verification (FV), and Metric Driven Verification (MDV) use SystemVerilog as a language construct. It provides numerous features like object-oriented programming and functional coverage, but learning the language has a steep curve especially for the freshers requiring good understanding of designs.

Depending on thecomplexity of the design, adding complicated  test scenarios manually is tedious and at times difficult to maintain.As the DV cycle continues, more and more UVM sequences are coded and many conditional  paths get added inthe testbench due to inter sequence dependencies. Any further change needs thorough understanding of all thesequences and requires modifications at multiple places. In this paper, we propose a smarter state pattern basedUVM sequence library and methodology that manages all the scenarios efficiently as the states are kept alignedwith the DUT system state. I. IntroductionAny testbenchscenariocanfundamentallybe brokendownintoa stimulus whichtargets the DUTinonestate andoncompletionof activitymovestheDUTtothesameordifferentstate.Manysuchstimuliarecascadedtocome upwithcomplexscenarios.ConventionallyUVMtestbencheshavemultiplestimuli(sequences)whicharerunin specific orders to obtain the required scenario. The problem with this approach is that there is a lot ofinterdependency of sequences and the user has to ensure every test, virtual sequence is following this. For instance,● Clocks sequence can’t be run before power sequence● Data sequences can’t be run before clock and reset sequences● Multiple power up/down dependency due to multiple power/clock domainsManaging these dependencies during the initial phase is still manageable but whennewdependencies needtobeaddeddue tonewscenariocoding, struggle starts todecodethesequencesandusuallyendupbreakingexistingtestcases. The methodologyproposedinthispaperisasmartwayofmanagingthesequencesviaastatepatternbasedsequence library. The design can be logically split into different units or states. The concept of state patterns isleveraged to layer different verification sequences. The states maintainedinthe testbenchhandles the DUTstatesdependencies hasslefree. Any new additions and modifications is just adding the new sequence to the required state. The full test suite canbe visualizedas a combinationof states whereeverystatehasabunchofsequencesassociatedwithit. Eachsequence will have the initial state asoneofthevaliddesignstatesandwillleadtoanothervaliddesignstate.Thetestalgorithmpicksarandomsequencefortheinitialstate.Thissequencecaneitherleadtoadifferent state or loopbacktothesamestateoncompletion.Oncethesequenceiscomplete,algorithmpicksrandomsequence as per the newstate .This loopcontinues ‘n’ number of times tocover 100%crossscenario.Fig.1isthepictorial representation of the different transitions possible for 2 states in the proposed methodology. Figure 1 : Different possible transitions for 2 states in the proposed methodology. The main advantage of this algorithm is that there is no need to code 100s of test cases for multiplescenarios, once the sequences are correctlyassociatedwiththestates,everythingisautomaticallyhandledandcrossscenarios can be achieved very quickly, similar to SVconstraints. The solution can be implemented with just 1sequence in each state and as more and more scenarios are coded, user just need to add the sequence to thecorresponding state sequence library.The proposed methodology involves :● State aware sequence library○ Data structure to store the sequences and the end states.○ It contains different APIs to add/remove/skip required sequences for any valid design state.○ Biasing hooks to modify the selection algorithm on the basis of past runs.● Test○ Top level test, executing the sequence libraries in accordance to state encountered○ Control to replay one particular arc● TB tool○ For complexdesigns,thenumberofpossiblestatestobeverifiedishigh.Forthosescenariosthereis alsoa provisiontoaddsequence andstates inXLSformat. TBtoolwhichisprovidedasapartof this dumps the UVM data structure which can directly be plugged into the setup.● Directed scenarios command line○ Usercanpassthelistofsequencesinorderofexecution.Toptestwillpickonlythegivenarc.Thisis helpful to create deterministic scenarios The whole scheme is analogous tolinkedlist, where eachnodeoflinkedlistisasystemstateofDUT,andhouses multiple sequences. Each sequence executed will give the next state of DUT and so on. Modifying thescenarios is verystraightforward. Like a linkedlist, nodes canbe removed,added,sandwichedwithoutanychangein base code. One added advantage users get is the logical boundary for the checker's implementation. Say after reset, all thesignals shouldbe parkedtoreset value andonce DUTis inpowereddownstate,alloutputswillbeisolated.Thesechecks caneasilybe implementedinthe respective states, the user is requiredtocallthecheckerbeforeexitingthestate.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

C-based tests, essential for architectural and boot-path validation, traditionally lack the sophisticated modeling capabilities of UVM RAL, leading to inefficient, brittle tests and a high incidence of false failures from undocumented or complex register behaviors. This paper introduces a novel, automated methodology that systematically bridges this gap. We leverage UVM RAL as the reference source to generate portable, robust, and efficient C-compatible register test collaterals. The proposed flow utilizes a UVM sequence to extract comprehensive register metadata—including waivers and access policies—into an intermediate Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, which is then synthesized into C data structures. Furthermore, we detail an intelligent register pruning technique that reduced test suite execution time by over 60% in a production environment. This methodology enhances verification accuracy by seamlessly porting IP-level waivers to the SoC context, has directly led to the identification of 35+ critical design defects, and has fundamentally improved regression efficiency and time-to-market.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

UVM Testbench generators can instantly create a basic UVM testbench template from scratch , but the VIP integration must be done manually. This makes  the testbench development activity difficult and time -consuming. Automating VIP integration is the solution, but this is not straightforward due to the lack of an industry-wide standard to exchange VIP metadata. In this paper, the authors present a non -proprietary VIP metadata template that can enable this automation via a Testbench Generator. This paper will further highlight how, without restricting the creativity of VIP developers, multiple vendor VIP titles have been successfully integrated into the ADI's UVM Testbench generator, with the help of this metadata. This method has enabled the DV engineers to instantly create a ready-to-simulate sophisticated UVM TB from scratch, reducing the efforts from weeks to minutes.

While SystemVerilog UVM remains the industry-standard verification framework of- fering constrained-random testing, functional coverage, and scalable environments, its steep learning curve and limited interoperability with modern software tools present notable challenges. This study explores an alternative approach using Python-based verification integrated with commercial simulators and compares it against a traditional UVM methodology. We implement two functionally equivalent verification environments for a UART IP core with an APB interface: a conventional SystemVerilog UVM testbench, and a Python-based solution combining pyuvm’s structured verification components with cocotb’s co-simulation capabilities. Both environments utilize industry-standard licensed simulators, ensuring a fair and practical comparison. Our evaluation focuses on four key metrics: simulation performance, func- tional coverage efficiency, testbench maintainability, and component reusability across projects. Generally, results shows that Python-based verification can effectively complement traditional UVM flows, especially in unit-level verification scenarios, where rapid development, dynamic stimulus generation, and seamless integration with modern software stacks offer significant advantages. Although UVM remains favorable for large-scale SoC verification due to performance and maturity, the Python-based approach presents a compelling alternative for targeted use cases in commercial verification environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Gradually gaining recognition within the verification communi ty, Python-based environments are being explored for their potential to become mainstream in future verification processes. This approach taps into the established SystemVerilog ecosystem, enabling effective reuse of SV -VIPs within Python settings. By leve raging the Direct Programming Interface (DPI -C) and the ctypes library, our method ensures seamless integration between Python testbenches and SV -VIPs. This integration not only utilizes Python's simplicity and readability but also fortifies its capacity for handling sophisticated hardware verification tasks. The paper illustrates this methodology with two practical implementations . It shows Python's evolving significance as a powerful and adaptable verification language and bridges the current divides between software flexibility and hardware verification demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Coverage Optimization with Formal-Guided Testcase Generation in UVM Verification](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_152.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—Processor verification faces significant challenges in state- space explosion and test coverage limitations, particularly in complex micro-architectures. Formal verification provides precise correctness guarantees but is constrained by computational overhead and scalability issues. Conversely, simulation-based approaches, including constrained- random verification and fuzz testing, provide scalability but often lack systematic guidance to effectively cover critical design regions and rarely exercised state transitions. To overcome these challenges, we propose Formal-Guided Test Sequence Optimization (FGTSO), a framework that integrates formal verification with simulation to systematically target coverage holes and enhance verification efficiency. FGTSO mitigates false alarms by refining formal assumptions and resolving black-box (BBOX) limitations through abstraction modeling. By continuously align- ing formal and simulation environments, FGTSO reduces test redundancy while enabling precise corner-case exploration. This approach enhances verification completeness, efficiently covering hard-to-reach design be- haviors that traditional methodologies often overlook. Experimental results on the CV A6 RISC-V core show that FGTSO achieved 99.91% branch coverage within 8 days, which is 4.41% higher than HyPFuzz’s 95.5%, effectively covering 98% of the previously uncovered regions. Furthermore, within 10 days, FGTSO achieved 100% coverage across all key metrics, including line, toggle, condition, and branch coverage. These results validate FGTSO’s ability to identify complex corner-case behaviors that traditional methods fail to reach, significantly enhancing verification completeness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[DV UVM based AMS co-simulation and verification methodology for mixed signal designs](downloads/dvcon/1160.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>-The comprehensive verification of Analo g Mixed Signal (AMS) design often encounters challenges due to misalignment in development schedules between the analog and digital designs. These discrepancies stem from divergent priorities in simulation cycles, particularly the emphasis on simulation accuracy for SPICE compared to functional verification needs of digital RTL. Furthermore, the time -consuming nature of SPICE solver simulations for analog, as opposed to event -based verilog simulations for Digital, results in significant disparities in completion times, impacting development turnaround times. Over the years, various Mixed Signal Verification (MSV) approaches have emerged to address these challenges, seeking to strike a balance between accuracy and performance trade-offs. These trade-offs, often driven by design dependencies such as the high-frequency nature of SPICE or low-power modeling of RTL (UPF) [1], which introduce significant productivity bottlenecks in test plan completion and functional verification sign -off, especially considering the growing presence of Mixed-Signal IPs. Building upon industry proven MSV methodologies, this paper describes a verification methodology tailored to resolve these challenges. This paper outlines the drivers behind this vision and provides detailed implementation insights. It begins with an overview of the design and the legacy verification flow, encompassing analog behavior using system verilog real number modeling (SV -RNM) for digital simulations and DV test cases. Subsequently, it delves into the intricacies of separate GUI-based SPICE simulations, including stimulus VCD vectors and their generation, followed by an exploration of verification gaps exposed by the "digital and analog verification in parallel" approach. The paper proceeds to offer an architectural overview of the new MSV testbench, supporting Digital Mixed Signal (DMS) and Analog Mixed Signal (AMS) Co-simulation with spice netlist, alongside guiding principles, and implementation details. It explains the approach for dynamically switching RNMs and SPICE netlists in regression runs, outlines the randomized nature of DV UVM testbench, and explores the analog response.

| **[Crafting a Million Instructions/Sec RISCV-DV HPC Techniques to Boost UVM Testbench Performance by Over 100x](downloads/dvcon/1008.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of opensource hardware, epitomized by the RISC-V processor, is opening up the avenues for opensource hardware verification tooling and flows. RISCV-DV [1] is an opensource random instruction generator widely used for functional verification of RISC-V cores [2]. This paper expounds on a parallelized RISCV-DV port [3] coded in Embedded UVM (eUVM). Novel techniques for enhancing testbench performance are also explored to affect a multicore UVM testbench implementation that generates millions of constrained-randomized RISC-V instructions in a second (using multicore parallelism), a speedup of over 100x when compared to the original RISCV-DV implementation coded in SystemVerilog (SV) UVM. I. I NTRODUCTION A. The Curious Case of Processor Verification High-end RISC CPU cores encompass complex hardware architectures comprising intricate maneuvers like instruction re- ordering, pipelines, branch prediction, and hyperthreading. Functional verification of such processors requires a significant effort involving generation of 1015 (thousands of millions of millions) constrained-random instructions [4]. The RISCV-DV project, coded in SV/UVM, generates only about 10,000 instructions in a second. At this rate, it takes several thousand machine years just to generate the required number of sequences of randomized RISC-V instructions. B. The Era of High Performance Computing Thanks to Dennard’s Scaling [5], CPU frequency and performance grew exponentially until the year 2005. For verification engineers, Dennard’s Scaling proved to be a boon. During the period of its impact, any increase in complexity of hardware designs (owing to Moore’s Law) was offset by a corresponding increase in CPU frequency and performance, thus affecting proportionately faster simulation runs. Dennard’s Scaling continued to hold its sway until the year 2005. Post that, its impact started to wane. That very year, Herb Sutter wrote a seminal paper titled “The Free Lunch Is Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software” [6]. Henceforth, software developers could not rely on an increase in processor frequency as a means to improve software efficacy. Programmers were now required to code multicore-enabled concurrent programs in order to boost software performance, marking the start of the era of High Performance Computing (HPC). Transistor Count (thousands) Frequency (MHz) Typical Power(Watts) Number of Logical Cores Single Threaded Performance (SpecINT X 10  )3 Data Sourced From: https://github.com/karlrupp/microprocessor-trend-data * * The Era of HPC The Era of Free Lunch Fig. 1: CPU Performance Over the Last 50 Years C. The Elephant in the Room Testbench performance is proving to be the proverbial elephant in the room. Even as modern HDL Simulators enable parallelized multicore simulation of RTL designs [7], little has been done to enable multicore parallelization of testbenches (refer section II-A), forcing verification engineers to adopt pragmatic techniques to enhance testbench efficacy. A distributed stimulus generator architecture that invokes Inter-Process Communication (IPC) for the exchange of generated transactions between multiple simulator instances (running as separate Linux processes) is explored in [8]. A multicore predictor architecture that utilizes a C++ thread pool via Direct Programming Interface (DPI) is realized in [9]. Contemporarily, the emergence of hybrid CPU/FPGA architectures and SoCFPGAs is enabling co-emulation platforms [10], wherein the Design under Test (DuT) gets mapped to an FPGA, but the testbench still continues to run on an HDL simulator. A “transaction-based acceleration” approach that proposes “an untimed hardware verification language domain” for accelerating the testbench for co-emulation has been broached in both [11] and [12]. 2 Incidentally, SV lacks support for Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) [13] at the very fundamental level. An essential tenet of TLM requires temporal decoupling of data from simulation time and events. All integral variables in SV (including the two-state types such as byte, shortint, int, and longint), and the expressions thereof, implicitly hold a value-change event that enables the end-user to write wait expressions (such as wait(a > b) ). As a result, any computational algorithm coded in SV executes an order of magnitude slower than the corresponding code in C/C++ and any other native programming languages. Section IX-I reflects further on the impact of non-native datatypes on the algorithmic performance of SV testbenches. II. T HE STATE OF THE ART A. SystemVerilog/UVM The golden reference RISCV-DV instruction generator implementation is coded in SV. But complex constraint solving and sub-optimal algorithmic implementation (refer section VI for details) limits the speed of its execution to only about ten thousand instructions in a second. Additionally, SV lacks native data-types. Consequently, any interface to an emulation platform requires interfacing with C/C++ via the DPI layer. Reference [14] offers a detailed exposition on how the runtime overhead of data exchange via DPI can have an adverse impact on testbench performance. From the HPC perspective, tool-level support for multicore parallelism is limited to RTL and Gate-Level simulations and requires Design Level Partitioning (DLP) [15]. Figure 2 depicts a typical verification setup with a partitioned RTL design as DuT. Since RTL coding semantics support only static variable scoping, multicore-enabled SV simulators are able to identify static RTL segments that can be simulated concurrently on multiple threads. Note that the exchange of signal data across the partition boundaries happens only by value (not by reference) and only via pins and ports that can be formally identified by the simulation tool. Therefore, it becomes possible for the simulator to introduce appropriate synchronization locks when passing data across the threads. TESTBENCH RTL Fig. 2: Multicore RTL Simulators On the other hand, a testbench is a completely different beast. A testbench is essentially behavioral, enables automatic data scoping, and allows sharing of data by reference across its various components. To this end, enabling parallelism in a testbench requires user-level programming language constructs [16] that facilitate synchronized access to shared data, which the current SV language standard lacks. Note that, though a testbench is always encapsulated in a separate module (or a program block), events corresponding to the testbench are temporally staggered from those pertaining to the DuT in order to avoid race conditions [17]. Temporal staggering of the DuT signal from those of the testbench is generally accomplished by use of the clocking block construct and/or the program block construct. Consequently, tasks related to a testbench are never executed in parallel to the simulation tasks associated with the DuT. As a result, a sequentially executed single threaded testbench becomes a bottleneck in a UVM/RTL simulation. B. Python - CocoTB [18] and PyUVM Despite being proposed as a futuristic language for Verification [19], Python has a huge drawback from the testbench performance perspective. Being an interpreted scripting language, Python is inherently inefficient and has been benchmarked to be fifty-seven times slower in comparison to native programming languages such as C/C++ [20]. 1) Pygen – The Python Port of RISCV-DV : Pygen is a python-based opensource port of RISCV-DV and is hosted as a sub- folder of the main RISCV-DV GitHub repository [1]. Pygen uses PyVSC [21] for solving constraints and is currently marred by poor runtime performance. Additionally, PyVSC does not deploy a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) solver and relies completely on Satisfiability (SAT) solvers for solving multi-variable constraints. Consequently, the solutions produced by PyVSC tend to have a non-uniform spread compared to SV and eUVM. Pygen currently performs more than a hundred times slower when compared to the SV version of RISCV-DV and generates less than a hundred random RISC-V instructions in a second. C. SystemC and C++ The SystemC port of the UVM library [22] currently relies on the CRA VE library [23] for constrained randomization. CRA VE provides an integrated interface to a set of BDD and SAT solvers. But as of now, it can not handle complex RISCV-DV constraints. Additionally, SystemC and CRA VE do not offer support for multicore parallelism. The CRA VE library uses wrapper template types (crv variable on line 2, in listing 1) to represent ran- dom variables. On account of that, random variables in CRA VE do not retain their native memory footprint, thus severely hindering its efficacy and prowess.

Specifications are not fully defined before the IP development phase; they tend to evolve along with the development. IP also goes through multiple variations accordingly before landing on the final version. This causes a substantial number of changes to the Verification IP, which accommodates multiple protocols and products. Catering to these variations without breaking existing features clutters the testbench with several conditionals, making the code fragile and maintenance a time - consuming task. The objective is to ensure that new code addition never breaks the functionality of old and tested code. Chain-of-Responsibility (CoR ) is an Object-Oriented Design Pattern , which can help achieve this objective. This paper discusses how Chain-of-Responsibility was used in IP that supported multiple protocols and products and its relative merits over traditional factory methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

The Advanced Micro controller Bus Architecture (AMBA) bus protocols is an example of interconnect specifications from ARM that standardizes on chip communication mechanisms between various functional blocks (or IP) for building high performance SOC designs. Over the years AMBA protocols as well have undergone updates and some new protocols are also introduced on the way. Due to this even if an IP does not have significant logic change, to be compliant with latest SoC architecture, IP’s input or output protocol gets updated. This calls for verification changes which must be done along with design update. Common proposal for this kind of change is to add a bridge to do conversion between two protocols. UVM component layering concept enables conversion of one complicated protocol transaction items into other type of protocol transaction items. With layering component, we can develop efficient reusable verification component to replace RTL block under development which does protocol conversion. This allows left shifting verification framework development effort which can reduces time to market with parallel development.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Integrating both C tests (containing the software instructions) and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) code (containing the rest of the testbench components aimed to verify the hardware) into a single verification testbench is a main approach for SoC level verification. However, this approach brings limitations for the control, reusability and randomization of tests. This paper demonstrates a technique that allows dynamically random generation and driving from an UVM verification environment of CPU instructions for SoC verification, using mainly a black-box approach for the design. The solution accommodates any design with one or more CPU cores, it is flexible for design changes and even for CPU Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) changes . The solution is fully compatible with UVM and non -UVM based verification testbenches. Examples show how this method is implemented in a testbench that automatically adapts and works with any microcontroller design configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[An Elegant scoreboard eco-system deploying UVM Callbacks, Parameterization for Multimedia designs from Imaging perspective](downloads/dvcon/91809.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— One of the principal features driving mobile market is the camera specification. Based on the needs of consumer market, there is a demand for camera sensors from the entry level to premium ones. An Image Sensor SOC will have many image processing sub -blocks to capture a high quality image. A CMOS image sensor has an Analog component which captures light, converts it to digital value and feeds it to digital pipeline. There are noises involved in Analog operation and manufacturing defects during fabrication. The digital pipeline has to mitigate these noises and defects for a high quality image output. Finally, the high quality image is sent to the host via Industry standard serial protocol. For a high quality image, advanced image processing IPs and algorithms are developed, resulting in increased design complexity. Additionally, the ever increasing need for higher resolution Image Sensors leads to larger designs. Due to market demand and aggressive schedules, the timelines for Design Verification shrink along with emphasis on quality validation. The key component for verification of any ISP (Image Signal Proces sing) algorithm is scoreboard, where we compare RTL output against golden reference model. A robust, configurable scoreboard architecture is vital to meet the verification quality in a short time frame. This architecture needs to be reusable across all sub-blocks. This paper details the practices followed in scoreboard implementation to achieve high quality verification within the stipulated time.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

However, current full -chip verification solutions focus heavily on UVM-driven digital verification testbenches, which are not feasible for analog circuits due to the high simulation run time of SPICE models. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of traditional full-chip verification flows and propose a comprehensiv e verification approach that includes both digital and analog functionality. We also explore two prevailing approaches to the modeling of analog blocks, the analog mixed-signal (AMS) approach and the digital mixed- signal (DMS) approach, and discuss the tra de-offs when using both approaches. Lastly, we propose a behavioral model solution to integrate analog functionality into the UVM -based chip-level verification environment, which can significantly reduce the risk of failure and ensure the complete functionality of the SoC.

The testbench combines a reactive stimulus technique with a Bayesian optimization algorithm to efficiently and adaptively explore the parameter space. Using a PCI Express receiver detection circuit as a case study, of which analog components are modeled in SystemVerilog with XMODEL primitives, the paper demonstrates how the testbench can identify design points that maximize margin and assess their sensitivity to secondary operating conditions . This approach enables adaptive, coverage -driven AMS verification, supporting more automated and scalable margin analysis in complex mixed-signal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

For example, a sign-s ign LMS adaptation algorithm for a d ecision-feedback equalizer (DFE) may converge to a false final state depending on the initial state. To detect the existence of such false final states, the testbench launches a sequence of trial runs, each starting from a rando m, unvisited initial state, until all possible states of the system are tried or traversed, or a problematic initial stat e is found. The simulation is run entirely in SystemVerilog by modeling the analog components of the high-speed wireline transceiver using the XMODEL primitives. To generate a sequence of trial runs based on the previous results and evaluate the termination conditions, the testbench utilizes a shared state coverage database and a global UVM event. The experimental results show that the testbench swiftly uncovers the false final states caused by high channel loss or insufficient constraints, and successfully confirms the global convergence of the adaptation loop when no such issues exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |
| **[A UVM Test-bench Skeleton Leveraging the Event Pool and Sequence Layering](downloads/dvcon/90997.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>— EM Microelectronic focuses on ultra-low power, low voltage integrated circuits for battery-operated and field-powered applications. It means that from the verification perspective, system-level mixed-signal test-benches with many power-aware checks are usually developed. The main contribution of this paper is a highly reusable UVM test - bench skeleton, which can be adapted step by step to verify the blocks of the system, as well as the whole System on Chip (SoC), including the HW-SW co-verification with firmware. This test-bench is top-level based; its unique feature is the possibility of parallel development of individual blocks and their UVCs by different verification engineers at the same time while sharing only a few common structures where these people cooperate: UVM layering (with translation) of system transactions, a global register model, processing of interrupts and a global UVM event pool. This feature allows a significant acceleration of development and is essential for reuse in future projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Eight directed tests verify the regulator's DC and AC response to line and load fluctuations, its programmed operating modes, power-supply rejection, etc. To enhance the effectiveness of the low-level directed tests in reaching unexpected corner cases, we apply high-level UVM randomization techniques to generate a randsequence of transient tests. Sub-cycle timing for stimulus and response is managed by means of the uvm_event_pool. Our goal is to present the UVM testbench mechanisms and coding techniques that proved most effective in verifying the circuit-level functionality of analog/mixed-signal blocks—a topic outside the usual scope of chip-level UVM testbench development.

This paper presents a novel, fully automated, and configurable UVM-based verification environment tailored for a generic Ethernet controller RTL. The RTL design supports various features sets and configurations, including optional Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) layers, variable SerDes widths, and diverse data rates, all driven by RTL defines generated via a builder tool. To address  testbench customization overhead and avoid manual rework for each RTL variant , a Python-based flow was developed to parse RTL defines and dynamically generate a configuratio n-specific UVM top- level using Jinja2 templates. This produces a testbench-matching Device Under Test (DUT), supporting full-controller and PCS-only modes, with parameterized interface connections and module instantiations. The UVM components— agents, environments , and scoreboards  are implemented using  a flexible, parameter -driven architecture , enabling rapid adaptation to new RTL builds. Integrated with a Makefile-based flow, the methodology supports one-command generation of both DUT and testbench. Results show a significant reduction in bring-up time, full reuse of verification components, and successful deployment across multiple DUT variants  with zero manual edits .</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

| **[A Graph-Based UVM Generation Framework for Complex State Machine Verification](downloads/dvcon/DVConEU_2025_paper_135.pdf)** | 1970-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>—The verification of complex designs  which include big control and protocol state -machines has always been a challenge. Although SystemVerilog and UVM have brought to the verification community the ability to create constrained random scenarios by means of test sequences and sequence libraries, the management of complex protocols from those sequences often lead s to spaghetti code, hard to maintain sequence libraries, directed tests or worse, not verifying all the targeted features. In parallel, we have seen the emergence of graph-based approaches resulting in the development of the PSS (Portable Stimulus Standard) , bringing the capacity to think differently a bout the use case scenarios, allowing them to be combined in a much bigger picture and enabling cross platform reuse. Those techniques are efficient at System Level  and for verification of complex SoC.  However, using them requires learning a new language, integrating new tools and are therefore less of an added value in complex IPs and subsystem projects already using UVM. Meanwhile, SystemVerilog provides interesting language constructs that can leverage standard UVM sequences for a more efficient constrained random generation, therefore accelerating the coverage closure of complex state machine designs. On the generation side, the randsequence keyword is powerful in generating graph-based scenarios providing that we stick to a well-structured template. Using its full capabilities  and adding a few tricks  we can even enable fully controlled graph explorations as well as automatic coverage closure completion, whether the design is fully controlled by the testbench or the testbench react s to the design behavior . On the coverage side, SystemVerilog covergroups allow the creation of state and state transition coverage. It is also possible to query the covergroups to check the completion of the scenarios. Integrated into a UVM sequence, we can define an automatic coverage closure graph-based scenario which will automatically cover all the required states and transitions of the design under test. This paper presents the overall approach, proposes an application proven template for the randsequence graph- based UVM sequence and leverages this by automating the template generation. A concrete example, based on the PCIe link training state-machine is then presented. The generation script and case example base class will be later provided as a gitlab project link  and an online generation tool available on www.aedvices.com/gbug (Graph Based UVM Generation)</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

Earlier the focus of the verification was to perform Digital Mixed-Signal (DMS) Verification using SystemVerilog Real Number Models (SV-RNM) to cover various scenarios of the PMIC, such as basic power up and power down sequence, I2C write and read  transactions, Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS), and testing the PMIC’s protection logic a gainst various fault scenarios . In this paper , we present how we performed AMS verification of a subset of those DMS items by re-using the UVM-based verification environment from DMS to AMS. We illustrate some key test scenarios that were verified accurately by running AMS simulations, present different mixed- signal configurations created for different scenarios, and describe how we could unearth critical  design issues with the verification methodology used. We have also mentioned whether we could correlate the simulated data from UVM -AMS verification with the actual silicon data to achieve confidence on the verification performed.</p></details> | <details><summary>DVCon...</summary><p>DVCon proceedings entry</p></details> |

This review explores the roles of ion channels in brain capillary endothelial cells and pericytes, focusing on their contributions to neurovascular coupling. Key endothelial ion channels, including Kir2.1, K ATP , transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and Piezo1, regulate membrane potential and calcium dynamics, facilitating rapid electrical and chemical signaling that modulates blood flow. Pericytes, categorized as ensheathing and thin strand, express ion channels such as K ATP , voltage-gated calcium channels, canonical TRP channels (TRPCs), and TMEM16A, which govern contractility and orchestrate blood flow responses. Additionally, we discuss channelopathies in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel diseases, hypertension, and ischemic stroke, where ion channel dysfunction impairs brain blood flow regulation. Emerging evidence underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting capillary ion channels to restore neurovascular function in these disorders.</p></details> | Physiology |

Any dysfunction in this process or unrepaired DNA damage leads to cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death. Cancer cells are known to exploit these mechanisms to continue dividing. Usually, DNA damage arrests replication, allowing the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway to activate, which repairs the DNA or bypasses the damage to support cell survival and preserve genome integrity. For DNA damage bypass or translesion synthesis (TLS), a group of low-fidelity polymerases perform error-prone DNA synthesis opposite damaged bases, where REV1 functions as the main scaffolding protein. Previously, we reported non-TLS functions of REV1, including its role in triggering DNA damage-dependent specific DNA metabolic processes. Methods and Results: In this study, we demonstrate that REV1 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression and that its loss causes arrest at the G2/M phase in flow cytometry analysis. This unexpected phenotype includes dysregulation of G2/M regulators, such as Cyclin B1 and tubulins, in REV1-deficient cells compared to controls, as quantified by Western blot. Additionally, phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 was significantly reduced in these REV1-deficient cells. These G2/M arrest features were even more pronounced in REV1-deficient cells treated with the tubulin inhibitor colchicine. Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized link between REV1 TLS polymerase inhibition and the G2/M cell cycle arrest.</p></details> | Genes |
| **[PIP <sub>2</sub> corrects an endothelial Piezo1 channelopathy](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2522750122)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain capillaries are sensors of neural activity. When a brain region is active, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) sense neuron-derived mediators and elicit a local increase in blood flow (functional hyperemia) to support the rise in metabolic needs. This hyperemic response involves a rapid electrical component and a slower chemical component that involves Gαq PCR (G q PCR) activation by agonists released from neurons. The intravascular forces associated with hyperemia engage mechanosensitive Piezo1-mediated signaling that serves a mechano-feedback control function to facilitate the return of elevated blood flow to basal levels. Whether G q PCR activity influences Piezo1 mechanosensitive signaling has not been explored, despite the potential significant implications of such crosstalk. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology and freshly isolated brain capillary ECs, we demonstrate that prostanoid or muscarinic G q PCR activation facilitates Piezo1 activity. Pharmacological studies revealed the involvement of Gαq and phospholipase C stimulation, as well as downstream phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) hydrolysis in Piezo1 activation, but not signaling triggered by metabolites of PIP 2 hydrolysis. Exogenous application of nanomolar-to-micromolar PIP 2 suppressed Piezo1 open probability. Brain capillary ECs from mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel disease, or Piezo1 gain-of-function mutation exhibited higher Piezo1 activity, that was corrected by exogenous ex vivo PIP 2 application. We finally tested in vivo the hypothesis that systemic PIP 2 administration restores functional hyperemia in EC-specific Piezo1 gain-of-function mutant mice suffering impaired blood flow.

Despite this emerging threat, few studies have examined the effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health in this region. We investigated the association between wildfire smoke exposure and pediatric asthma control in Vermont and upstate New York. Methods We extracted data from the electronic health records of youth aged 3–21 years diagnosed with asthma within a single regional healthcare system and included three clinical measures of asthma control: Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (3–4 years), Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (5–21 years), and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma control guidelines (3–21 years). We first compared asthma control in the smoke-affected summer of 2023 to the largely unaffected summers of 2022 and 2024 using regression models, controlling for pollen exposure. We then obtained airborne particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) values within ZIP codes and used regression models to investigate the association between asthma control and PM 2.5 during the smoke-affected summer of 2023. Results The study sample included 1,217 encounters (mean age 9.1 ± 4.4 years, 57% male). Asthma control was significantly worse in the severely smoke-affected summer of 2023 versus 2022 for two of the three clinical measures but was not different between 2023 and 2024 for any of the clinical measures. Within summer 2023, there were no significant associations between ZIP code–level PM 2.5 and asthma control for any of the three clinical measures. Conclusions Wildfire smoke exposure in the Northeast was associated with decreased asthma control in this pediatric population, though not consistently across years and all clinical measures. As climate change drives longer and more intense wildfire seasons, continued monitoring is needed to understand the impact on pediatric respiratory health in this historically low-exposed region.</p></details> | Environmental Health |

Conventional verification methods, particularly traditional directed testbenches, are often plagued by scalability, reusability, and adequate functional coverage issues. In order to solve these problems, this project is designed to enhance the AXI protocol verification process through the development of a UVM-based verification environment for an AXI slave interface. With the integration of constrained-random stimulus generation and coverage-driven methods, the UVM testbench ensures extensive validation across a variety of test cases, including increment and wrap bursts with different beat lengths (4, 8, and 16). The shift from a traditional testbench to the UVM-based approach not only makes verification easy but also improves accuracy, effectiveness of debugging, and coverage exponentially. Through methodical testing and validation, the enhanced environment tests UVM's capability to implement a stable, reusable, and scalable solution for AXI protocol verification.</p></details> |  |

The article approaches the struggle to maintain efficiency and thoroughness against increasingly heterogeneous architectures integrating diverse processing elements, accelerators, and high-speed interconnects. This technical article presents an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning-driven framework that fundamentally transforms UVM verification workflows by embedding intelligent automation, adaptive learning, and autonomous decision-making capabilities throughout the verification lifecycle. The proposed system leverages multiple AI paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning algorithms implementing Proximal Policy Optimization and Deep Q-Networks for adaptive stimulus generation that learns optimal testing strategies through interaction with designs under verification, supervised ensemble learning models combining gradient boosting and neural networks for predictive coverage trajectory forecasting, and unsupervised learning techniques employing Variational Autoencoders with density-based clustering for automated failure triage and root cause inference. Implementation on production-grade FPGA-based SoC environments featuring high-speed network controllers, storage interfaces, and interconnect fabrics demonstrates substantial improvements across multiple dimensions. The framework achieves significant acceleration in coverage closure timelines, dramatic reduction in debug effort through intelligent failure categorization and automated root cause summarization, and notable decrease in computational resource consumption while maintaining or exceeding verification quality metrics compared to traditional manual methodologies. The modular architecture ensures extensibility to emerging verification challenges, including mixed-signal validation, formal property checking, power-aware simulation, and security verification, with the incorporation of Explainable AI techniques providing transparency into automated decision-making processes essential for safety-critical and certified environments. Transfer learning policies allow policies trained on similar designs to serve well on new verification platforms with little or no additional training needs, which is many times faster to deploy than training policies in semiconductor product lines. The framework is a paradigm shift of tool-assisted verification to AI-assisted autonomous verification systems that continuously learn, evolve, and optimize through project lifecycles, which puts intelligent automation as a necessary feature of maintaining semiconductor innovation and first-silicon success in successive generations of more and more complex System-on-Chip implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering</p></details> |

Traditional verification processes tend to break RTL functional verification and embedded software validation into independent processes causing blind spots to surface late in the silicon lifecycle. The following paper describes a simple way of including C-based software tests into UVM-based hardware testbenches to provide unified stimulus generation, better coverage closure and more realistic corner-case verification. We outline the infrastructure needed, the way promising virtual registers are designed, and how the means of synchronization with their help are achieved so as to enable coherent HW-Software co-verification. The measures in coverage and bug detection are shown by a real-world case study of an AXI-based SoC. They provide lessons learned and best practices in order to facilitate the adoption of this methodology at scale by the design teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Applied Mathematics</p></details> |

Traditional verification approaches struggle to adequately address the unique challenges posed by Single Instruction, Multiple Thread execution models, dynamic thread scheduling, and complex interactions between compute units and multi-level cache systems. This article presents a comprehensive Universal Verification Methodology-based testbench architecture specifically designed for GPU compute unit verification, addressing critical gaps in existing verification practices through innovative SIMT-aware stimulus generation, integrated memory subsystem modeling, and scalable test generation frameworks. The proposed framework combines established UVM principles with GPU-specific verification techniques, creating a modular and reusable architecture that supports diverse configurations while maintaining systematic coverage collection and intelligent corner case detection. Extensive experimental evaluation across representative GPU workloads demonstrates substantial improvements in verification quality, debug efficiency, and development productivity compared to traditional approaches. The architecture's parameterized design enables seamless adaptation across different GPU generations while its extensible structure provides a foundation for future verification challenges, including AI accelerators and chiplet-based architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Globa...</summary><p>Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology</p></details> |

Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms of EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis across different disease subtypes remain poorly understood. Global DNA methylation profiling can provide insight into tumor heterogeneity and disease mechanisms. Methods: To further characterize the underlying biology of EBV(+) DLBCL, we performed a global methylome analysis of a cohort of EBV(+)/(−) DLBCL. Illumina MethylationEPIC array data were generated from a curated set of DLBCL tissue samples (n = 43) from a rural patient population with defined EBV status and immunodeficiency background. Differential methylation analyses were conducted using linear mixed models to identify significant methylation changes associated with EBV status. Results: Principle component analysis (PCA) and probe-level comparisons revealed a distinct, globally hypermethylated DNA methylome in EBV(+) DLBCL compared to EBV(−) cases, and an overall hypomethylated profile in all DLBCL relative to control tissues. We identified a total of 117,334 differentially methylated probes mapping to 1557 cancer-associated genes in EBV(+) versus EBV(−) DLBCL, and 330,872 probes mapping to 4230 cancer-associated genes in all DLBCL versus controls. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted distinct biological processes in EBV(+) DLBCL, including P53 feedback loops (hypermethylated genes) and MAPK signaling (hypomethylated genes). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that EBV(+) DLBCL is epigenetically distinct from EBV(−) disease, with alterations that may contribute to clinical heterogeneity and potentially serve as biomarkers for disease classification and therapeutic targeting.</p></details> | Cancers |

There is a need to understand factors that impact rural caregiving to build equitable health services, yet there is a lack of research that weighs both strengths and challenges. Our goal is to examine these factors as identified by rural caregivers in qualitative interviews. Research design and methods A purposive sample of rural-dwelling caregivers (n = 18) was recruited from a state-wide registry in a predominantly rural state. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by phone and interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed. Results We identified areas of strengths and resilience among rural caregivers, including informal support from friends and neighbors, which often bridged gaps in formal services. Rural caregivers also identified barriers to service use, such as long distance, travel and a lack of awareness within the healthcare system. Discussion and implications These challenges increase caregivers’ needs for tailored family centered care coordination and highlight the necessity of providing diverse care delivery options. Our findings highlight that community-based efforts and policy should address barriers and rural disadvantage, while also fostering and empowering the resilience of caregivers in their rural home environment.</p></details> | PLOS One |

Procuring food through HWFP activities may have important food security and nutrition benefits, while also enhancing food sovereignty and food system resilience. This cross-sectional study examined the effect of HWFP activities on food security status, fruit and vegetable intake, and meat consumption. Methods: We used data collected in 2021 and 2022 from adults (n = 2001) through two statewide representative surveys in Maine and Vermont, United States. Dietary intake was assessed using the Dietary Screener Questionnaire. Food security status was assessed using the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 6-item short-form food security module. We analyzed the data using linear regression, logistic regression, and ordinal logistic regression models. Results: Sixty-one percent of respondents engaged in HWFP activities; the majority of those gardened. Households engaging in most individual HWFP activities had greater odds of being food insecure. HWFP engagement was positively associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Specifically, gardening was associated with an additional one cup-equivalent in fruit and vegetable consumption per week compared to respondents that did not garden. Furthermore, when exploring these relationships disaggregated by food security status, we find that this effect is stronger for food insecure households than food secure households. Respondents from households that hunted were more likely to eat wild game meat and also consumed red and white meat more frequently compared to households that did not hunt. Conclusions: Overall, our results indicate potential nutrition and food security benefits from engaging in HWFP activities. Future research should continue to examine a full suite of HWFP activities and their relationship to diet, health, food security, and food sovereignty.</p></details> | Nutrients |

Although Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbenches have now become de facto industry standard for reusable digital verification IP (VIP), their reusability in mixed-signal environments is not yet fully explored. Conventional AMS verification flows are substantially dependent upon custom analog testbenches, in many instances leading to duplication of effort and atomistic approaches in work-flows within design teams. This paper presents a reusable UVM architecture that is organized into a structure to be used to a mixed-signal design. Incorporation of real-number modeling, uniform interface adapters and strong transaction-level stimulus extends a method between event-driven digital testbenches and continuous-time analog continuum. A case file is introduced on a reusable Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) verification IP, which manifestly exhibits gains in coverage, debug productivity and design cycle time. The methodology proposed is helpful to SoC teams so that aspects of faster closure with increased confidence can be made and at the same time provide standardization in reusable AMS VIP libraries that can be used in future designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering</p></details> |

Kerusakan hubung singkat ke suplai tegangan dan ke ground bisa saja terjadi pada input atau output rangkaian penyusun di dalam rangkaian terpadu multivibrator. Input suatu rangkaian penyusun di dalam rangkaian terpadu multivibrator akan tetap bernilai logika 1 (tinggi) jika kerusakan hubung singkat ke suplai tegangan terjadi pada input rangkaian penyusun tersebut. Sedangkan output suatu rangkaian penyusun di dalam multivibrator akan tetap bernilai logika 0 (rendah) tidak mempedulikan apapun logika nilai inputnya jika terjadi kerusakan hubung singkat ke ground pada input rangkaian penyusun tersebut. Oleh sebab itu, hubung singkat ke suplai tegangan dan ke ground yang terjadi di dalam rangkaian terpadu multivibrator harus dideteksi sebelum dikirimkan ke konsumen. Desain UVM testbench yang diajukan untuk memverifikasi rangkaian terpadu multivibrator dari kerusakan hubung singkat yang terjadi di dalamnya. Testbench tersusun dari beberapa komponen, yaitu: sequence, sequencer, interface, driver, monitor, scoreboard, agent, environment, test, dan testbench top. Sedangkan DUT (Design Under Test) merupakan desain yang akan diuji, dalam hal ini adalah rangkaian terpadu multivibrator. Kode UVM testbench dan DUT dalam Bahasa SystemVerilog kemudian disimulasikan menggunakan software Questasim 2021.1. Hasil simulasi menujukkan kesesuaian dengan diagram waktu DUT. Hasil transcript dari Questasim juga memberikan keterangan “UVM_ERROR : 0”.</p></details> | <details><summary>Jurna...</summary><p>Jurnal Penelitian Inovatif</p></details> |

| **[A volumetric analysis of timing and duration of T2/FLAIR changes on MRI following radiation therapy in patients with low-grade IDH-mutant glioma](https://doi.org/10.1093/nop/npaf024)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstract Background Patients with IDH-mutant low-grade glioma (LGG) can achieve many years of survival with radiation (RT) and chemotherapy. There is a risk of overtreatment and negative treatment side effects if these patients are unnecessarily retreated due to perceived tumor progression in the absence of true tumor regrowth. A better understanding of volumetric postradiation FLAIR changes will help with the clinical interpretation of disease progression/treatment effect and will help guide management decisions. We conducted this research to characterize the changes in MRI FLAIR hyperintensity that occur in LGG patients following RT, to better understand the radiation-treatment effects or “pseudoprogression” that occurs in the absence of true tumor regrowth. Methods Serial MRI scans of patients with LGG were reviewed, including pre-RT and for 2.5 years post-RT. Segmentation for volumetric analysis was performed with manual supervision using ITK-SNAP (open-source segmentation software). Descriptive statistics are reported. Results Sixteen patients with histologic grade 2 gliomas were included. 159 MRI scans were segmented using ITK-SNAP (median 9.5 MRIs/patient). Nine of 16 MRIs showed decreasing FLAIR volume immediately post-RT, while 7/16 showed increasing FLAIR volume. After the initial post-RT MRI, 12/16 patients had MRIs with an increase in FLAIR volume sometime during the first year. The FLAIR volume stabilized or decreased a median of 18.4 months and a mean of 15.0 months post-RT. Conclusions FLAIR hyperintensity changes on MRI are highly variable in the first 1.5 years post-RT in low-grade glioma, but after 1.5 years, FLAIR volumes stabilize and decrease, likely indicating the inflection point where post-RT pseudoprogression stabilizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuro...</summary><p>Neuro-Oncology Practice</p></details> |

The catalysts were investigated for the simultaneous total oxidation of three model compounds: propene, toluene, and CO, commonly associated with “cold start pollutants” in automotive exhausts. Only Au showed low catalytic activity, while Pt nanoparticles were active, with a greater concentration of accessible Pt nanoparticles corresponding with increased catalytic activity. Interestingly, having both metals present on the same catalyst together was preferential for producing higher activity in the total oxidation of CO, propene, and toluene. The loadings of Pt nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, as well as the synthesis method, were important controlling factors. The order of metal loading deposition was influential, depositing Au and Pt sequentially resulted in surface enrichment of the latter deposited metal, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. When Au and Pt were loaded simultaneously, alloy formation occurred, and the surface Pt enrichment was more moderate, but still maintaining better catalytic performance compared with the pure Pt catalyst.</p></details> | ChemCatChem |

However, the pathophysiology of stress has an extremely ramified mechanism affecting several body systems at once. Of course, stress can be regarded as one of the linksin the pathogenesis of periodontitis, but only in combination with many other factors such as oral microflora, lifestyle, nutrition, heredity, etc. As a result, the periodontium acts as one of the body structures that can be exposed to the pathological effects of stress. 53 domestic and foreign sources containing information on the physiology and impact of stress on the human body and periodontal tissues were analyzed. A systematic search of articles was performed in the PubMed and eLibrary databases. Stress is an important factor influencing the occurrence and progression of changes in periodontal tissues. An individual approach to optimizing the level of psychoemotional stress can be regarded as one of the methods for preventing diseases such as periodontitis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unive...</summary><p>University proceedings.

To conduct a study of the nature of injuries to the civilian population as a result of gunshot wounds and the nature of assistance for such injuries at the prehospital stage. Materials and methods. The study is retrospective, in order to achieve this goal, an analysis of the results of treatment of 46 wounded civilians who were injured in the facial area in a local military conflict was carried out. Of the total number of women surveyed, there were 15 (32.6%), and men – 31 (67.3%) people. The average age was 38 ± 4 years. Results and conclusion. It was found that most of the victims of gunshot wounds received multiple wounds, which led to injuries of moderate severity – 45,6%. Facial injuries led to capillary bleeding, which was noted in 82.6% of the victims. At the same time, selfand mutual assistance prevailed as first aid for such wounded people at the scene – 50% of observations. It should be noted that such assistance was performed in full and correctly in 80.4% of the observations, in the remaining 13.0% of cases errors were noted related to incorrect dressing and failure to perform temporary hemostasis. Moreover, all errors were recorded during the provision of first aid by random witnesses who do not have the skills to provide such assistance. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the correctness and timeliness of first aid is of great importance in the development of complications in the wounded in the immediate postoperative period.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unive...</summary><p>University proceedings.

Gene expression is predominantly suppressed during mitosis. Bookmarking provides the guidance for the resumption of gene expression in progeny cells that is obligatory for physiological control of lineage commitment, specialized cell structure and phenotypic function. While regulatory continuity is supported by the persistence of genome-associated regulatory complexes, altered bookmarking mediates plasticity for responsiveness to physiological cues. Bookmarking fidelity ensures genome integrity and controls expression of tumor suppressors and proto-oncogenes. Cancer-compromised aberrations in bookmarking results in transcriptional dysregulation and the initiation of tumor-associated processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bioch...</summary><p>Biochemistry and Cell Biology</p></details> |

At this stage, the problems of understanding the pathophysiology of relapsing polychondritis, its diagnosis, assessment of activity and prognosis, as well as treatment have not been resolved. The disease develops through exacerbation of remissions. It is characterized by clinical polymorphism, requiring a team approach from specialists from different specialties. Manifesta-tions usually occur gradually over time, and their frequency depends on the duration, activity and severity of the disease. Clinical heterogeneity of the disease is a source of diagnostic errors. The differential diagnosis in most cases concerns the involvement of each organ, which may appear immediately in a particular patient, but in most cases appears gradually, with an average of two symptoms at the onset of the disease. Purpose of the study: analysis of a clinical case of relapsing polychondritis, the clinical picture, the need for early diagnosis and the prescription of pathogenetic therapy. The article discusses our own clinical observation of relapsing polychondritis identified in a 62-year-old patient. A differential diagnosis was made between the patient’s disease, systemic scleroderma and necrotizing vasculitis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unive...</summary><p>University proceedings.

We recently identified two capillary endothelial cell (cEC)-based mechanisms that control cerebral blood flow in vivo: 1) electrical signaling, mediated by extracellular K + -dependent activation of strong inward rectifying K + (Kir2.1) channels, which are steeply activated by hyperpolarization and thus are capable of cell-to-cell propagation, and 2) calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, which reflects release of Ca 2+ via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R)—a target of G q -protein-coupled receptor signaling. Notably, Ca 2+ signals were restricted to the cell in which they were initiated. Unexpectedly, we found that these two mechanisms, which were presumed to operate in distinct spatiotemporal realms, are linked such that Kir2.1-dependent hyperpolarization induces increases in the electrical driving force for Ca 2+ entry into cECs through resident TRPV4 channels. This process, termed electrocalcium (E-Ca) coupling, enhances IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2+ release via a Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release mechanism, and allows focally induced hyperpolarization, including that initiated by ATP-dependent K + (K ATP ) channels, to travel cell-to-cell via activation of Kir2.1 channels in adjacent cells, providing a mechanism for the “pseudopropagation” of Ca 2+ signals. Computational modeling supported the basic features of E-Ca coupling and provided insight into the intracellular processes involved. Collectively, these data provide strong support for the concept of E-Ca coupling and provide a mechanism for the spatiotemporal integration of diverse signaling pathways in the control of cerebral blood flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</p></details> |

Las industrias, como la automotriz y la informática móvil, no solo están requiriendo un mayor número de chips, sino que también enfrentan una expansión en las aplicaciones que requieren estos circuitos. Esto incluye desde microprocesadores avanzados hasta sistemas embebidos complejos, que requieren el uso de Lenguajes de Descripción de Hardware (HDL) a nivel de Transferencia de Registros (RTL) y expertos en verificación. La verificación funcional se vuelve crucial para asegurar que los sistemas diseñados cumplan con los requisitos especificados en las propuestas de los clientes. Para llevar a cabo esta verificación, se emplea la Metodología Universal de Verificación (UVM), una metodología estandarizada que facilita la creación de entornos de verificación modulares, mantenibles, escalables y reutilizables. Este trabajo propone la aplicación de UVM en la creación de entornos de verificación basados en agentes, lo que garantiza una alta modularidad, capacidad de expansión y reutilización, mejorando la efectividad de la verificación y permitiendo una rápida detección de errores en el diseño.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pädi ...</summary><p>Pädi Boletín Científico de Ciencias Básicas e Ingenierías del ICBI</p></details> |

Generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, demonstrated its ability to produce accurate and valuable assertions by employing text-based prompts and image-fed inputs, significantly reducing the required manual effort. This research presents a way of generating System Verilog assertions using the ChatGPT prompt, presenting an image to the Large Language Models, and requesting the assertions needed for the respective protocol. This approach shows the potential for artificial intelligence to revolutionize functional verification by automating complex tasks, ultimately ensuring faster and more reliable System-on-Chip development. The assertions generated by the Large Language Models are integrated into an existing Advance Peripheral Bus verification environment. This process involves running the assertions on a free EDA Playground platform with all three simulators (Cadence Incisive, Mentor Questa, and Synopsys Verilog Compiler Simulator). The main conclusions are that using ChatGPT-4.0 for generating System Verilog assertions significantly reduces the time and effort required for functional verification, demonstrating its potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy in verifying complex System-on-Chip designs.</p></details> | Systems |

Dieser wachsende Datenzugang eröffnet eine Vielzahl an Anwendungsmöglichkeiten, stellt jedoch eine Gefahr für die Privatsphäre und Sicherheit erfasster Personen dar. Zwar werden flüchtige Bildsequenzen i.d.R. bereits in der Kamerahardware ausgewertet, da die Systeme für Anpassungen und kontinuierliche Optimierungen jedoch kontaktierbar gehalten werden müssen, existiert stets ein potenzieller Zugang für das mutwillige Mitschneiden des Bildstroms und damit die Möglichkeit, große Bildmengen mit Hilfe automatisierter Algorithmen sehr einfach auf schädliche Informationen auszuwerten (Spionage, Identitätsdiebstahl uvm.). Um einen Wettlauf mit sich stetig weiterentwickelnden Angriffsvektoren zu vermeiden (kontinuierliche Abwehr von Zugriffen), wurde im vorliegenden Projekt ein Sicherheitsmodul entwickelt, welches den technischen Bildentstehungsprozess von Optiksystemen derart verändert, dass jedes erstmalig errechnete und damit vorfindbare Bild bereits vollflächig unkenntlich ist (Eliminierung der Schadensgrundlage und damit der Zugriffsmotivation), demnach keinen Zugang zu einzelnen Identitäten erlaubt (bspw. ein Auslesen eines Kennzeichens), jedoch auf Grundlage der geringen Restinformation, mit Hilfe speziell entwickelter Neuronaler Netze, noch auf oberflächliche Informationen auslesbar bleibt (bspw. Erkennung eines Objekts als PKW).</p></details> |  |

| **[Chromosome 3p deletion leads to extensive genomic alterations in diverse cancers and confers synthetic lethality in uveal melanoma](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.01.21.700826)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ABSTRACT Chromosome 3p (chr3p) is frequently deleted in multiple cancers, indicating the presence of shared tumor suppressors. Analysis of genomic alterations in 33 different cancer types implicates the deletion or deleterious mutations of SET-domain-containing 2 ( SETD2 ) at chr3p21 in significantly facilitating the formation of isochromosomes, consisting of two identical mirror-imaged arms, thereby promoting genomic instability conducive to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements and rapid cancer genome evolution. Fracturing of dicentric isochromosomes during cell division is pervasive and follows the dynamic fragmentation pattern of solids under impulse. Across cancers, isochromosomes form most frequently on chr8 to amplify the MYC -containing q-arm and chr17 to delete the TP53 -containing p-arm. In the most aggressive uveal melanoma (UVM) subtype, chr3 deletion also includes MITF , a critical melanocyte differentiation and survival factor, and co-occurs with chr8q amplification. We demonstrate that MITF is a master transcriptional regulator of GNAQ / GNA11 , mutated in 90% of UVM patients, and the associated synthetic-lethal genes identified by recent CRISPR screening studies. MITF maintains MAPK and calcium homeostasis in UVM, and its deletion is thus accidental, creating an early crisis during oncogenesis. We further show that MITF, MYC, and GNAQ/GNA11 form coupled regulatory feedback loops in the melanocyte lineage, and MITF deletion in UVM creates acute dependency on MYC-mediated rescue via chr8q amplification, often as a consequence of isochromosome formation. The discovered feedback loops predict both overall and relapse-free patient survival within the most aggressive UVM subtype, explain sensitivity to therapeutic gene perturbations, and inform effective combinatorial therapies.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-omics integrative analysis of stemness-associated pathological signatures to guide prognosis and therapeutic strategies in uveal melanoma](https://doi.org/10.1097/js9.0000000000004914)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common intraocular malignancy in adults and exhibits poor prognosis upon metastasis. Stemness, a hallmark of cancer aggressiveness, remains understudied in UVM, especially in relation to pathology-derived features and therapeutic implications. Methods: We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk transcriptomic data, and histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) to systematically investigate stemness-associated heterogeneity in UVM. High stem-like (HStem) malignant subpopulations were identified via CytoTRACE and further analyzed using hdWGCNA to determine signature genes. A machine learning-based pathological image-derived prognostic score (IPS) system was constructed using multiscale pathomic features and benchmarked across seven survival models. Results: HStem cells exhibited elevated oncogenic and metabolic activity, strong fibroblast interactions, and enriched expression of stemness-related genes. Nine key pathomic image features were selected to construct the IPS model, which stratified patients by prognosis and predicted immunotherapy response. High-IPS tumors showed immune-cold phenotypes and were more sensitive to ABT-888, ATRA, AZ628, and temsirolimus. Conclusions: This study highlights a novel integrative framework combining pathomics and scRNA-seq to decode stemness-driven heterogeneity in UVM. The IPS model offers a non-invasive tool for risk stratification and therapeutic guidance, paving the way for precision oncology in rare ocular malignancies. Notably, the IPS was derived and internally validated within a single TCGA-UVM cohort, and its generalizability to other populations requires validation in independent multi-center cohorts.</p></details> |  |

CDKN2AIPNL exhibits a paradoxical role in cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies but promoting solid tumor progression, yet its systematic pan-cancer characteristics remain unelucidated. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze CDKN2AIPNL’s expression patterns, prognostic value, genetic alterations, and molecular mechanisms across multiple tumor types using public datasets including TCGA, GTEx, HPA, and tools such as GEPIA2, cBioPortal, TIMER2, STRING, and BioGRID. We performed expression difference analysis, survival analysis (overall survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival), genetic alteration analysis, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration analysis, and gene/protein interaction enrichment analysis. Results showed that CDKN2AIPNL was significantly upregulated in multiple tumors (e.g., LIHC, UVM, BRCA, LUAD) and downregulated in others (e.g., KICH, KIRP, THCA), with high tumor specificity. Elevated CDKN2AIPNL expression correlated with poor overall survival in LIHC (HR = 1.7, p = 0.0026), UVM (HR = 26, p = 2.2e-6), BRCA (HR = 26, p = 2.2e-6), LUAD (HR = 1.36, p = 0.049), PCPG (HR = 1.71, p = 0.0012), and TGCT (HR = 0.37, p=0.023), and was associated with advanced tumor stages in metabolically active cancers. Genetic alterations (amplifications and mutations) were frequent in KIRC (&amp;gt;5%) and ACC (&amp;gt;4%), with all mutations localized to the XTBD region, and amplification predicted poor prognosis in PRAD (p = 0.008) while mutations conferred favorable outcomes in BLCA. CDKN2AIPNL expression positively correlated with CAF infiltration in ESCA, KICH, UVM, and other tumors, and interacted with MYC, XRN2, and CHAMP1 to regulate metabolic reprogramming, cell cycle, and immune suppression. Our findings systematically reveal CDKN2AIPNL’s dual role in tumorigenesis and validate it as a potential pan-cancer prognostic biomarker, providing novel insights for cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy.</p></details> |  |

In this situation, alternative techniques are necessary for the estimation of distances to these sources. In this paper, we estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and 5 blazar candidates of uncertain type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on board Swift observes sources in uvw 2, uvm 2, uvw 1, u , b , and v filters, while the ground-based SARA telescopes at Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain and Cerro Tololo, Chile observed sources in <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>g</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo accent="true">′</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.25em"/> <mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo accent="true">′</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> <mml:mspace width="0.25em"/> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo accent="true">′</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width="0.25em"/> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>z</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo accent="true">′</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:math> filters.

Even after decades of development, producing fine droplets with a uniform size distribution and high production rate in an atomizer is still a challenge. The purpose of this study is to review the significance of the latest advances in ultrasonic atomization and how they have affected spray drying technology, which is essential to the improvement of powder synthesis and processing. Furthermore, ultrasonic atomization can be used to evaluate the usefulness of developed in powder engineering for a variety of applications. These observations offer important insights into the behavior of the droplets generated by the ultrasonic atomizer inside the particular spray dryer reactors that are being used. Numerous researchers have reported their innovations in spray dryer equipped with either Ultrasonic Vibrating Mesh Atomizers (UVM-As) and Surface Acoustic Wave Atomizer (SAW-As) which is known as Ultrasonic Atomizer. Understanding the fundamentals of ultrasonic atomization enables the advancement of spray dryer innovations and technology. Therefore, recent advances in spray drying technology indicate that more compact system designs can be achieved without compromising energy efficiency, thereby contributing to improved overall process performance. In this context, systematic evaluation of atomizer performance is essential at the early stages of atomizer development, particularly in terms of droplet size distribution, energy consumption, and operational stability. Based on the collective findings reported in the literature, vibrating mesh atomizer-assisted spray drying has demonstrated significant potential for producing finer particles with narrower size distributions, making it a promising atomization approach for advanced spray drying applications. HIGHLIGHTS Reviews recent advances and innovations in ultrasonic vibrating mesh atomizers. Highlights research progress of ultrasonic atomizer in spray drying Evaluates spray drying applications for productions of nano- and micro-particle.

| **[Decoding HSP90AA1-driven inflammatory signaling in the uveal melanoma microenvironment: an integrated analysis at single-cell resolution](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1730622)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose Decoding key regulators in the uveal melanoma (UVM) tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for understanding disease progression and developing novel immunotherapy strategies. This study aims to integrate advanced computational methods and single-cell technologies to identify and validate key molecular regulators mediating inflammatory and immune signal transduction in UVM, and to explore their potential as therapeutic targets. Patients and methods An integrated strategy was employed, first utilizing a network-based computational screening approach to identify core regulatory genes associated with UVM progression. Subsequently, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed to precisely delineate the expression profile of the identified key gene, HSP90AA1, across different cell populations in the UVM microenvironment at single-cell resolution. Finally, the functional role of HSP90AA1 was rigorously validated through siRNA-mediated knockdown, in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo xenograft model. Results Our computational analysis identified HSP90AA1 as a central hub gene. Single-cell analysis revealed that HSP90AA1 is widely expressed across multiple cell types within the UVM tumor microenvironment, particularly in malignant cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages. Functional validation confirmed that knockdown of HSP90AA1 significantly suppressed UVM cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumor growth. Mechanistically, silencing HSP90AA1 markedly inhibited key inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB, STAT3), leading to a significant reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2, while promoting apoptosis. Conclusion By integrating computational biology screening and single-cell resolution analysis, this study successfully decodes HSP90AA1 as a key regulator of the UVM inflammatory and immune microenvironment. These findings, grounded in single-cell insights and confirmed by rigorous experimental validation, reveal the tumor’s intrinsic “chaperone dependency” and highlight HSP90AA1 as a highly promising therapeutic target. Targeting HSP90AA1 may offer a new strategy for modulating the UVM tumor immune microenvironment and overcoming tumor progression.</p></details> |  |

| **[ASPHD1 Is a tumor-suppressive and prognostic marker in glioma](https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1694116)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction Glioma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. To identify novel prognostic biomolecules and potential therapeutic targets, we investigated Aspartate betahydroxylase domain-containing protein 1 (ASPHD1), encoded by the ASPHD1 gene and predicted to function as a Fe (II)/2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase involved in peptide amino-acid modification. ASPHD1 has not previously been characterized in glioma. Methods We assessed its expression and prognostic value using transcriptomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Co-expressed gene enrichment and DNA-methylation analyses were performed, and associations between ASPHD1 expression and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses of ASPHD1 coexpressed genes indicated enrichment in synaptic signaling, ion-channel activity, and calcium-signaling pathways, suggesting a link with neuronal and synaptic function. Results ASPHD1 expression showed a pronounced inverse correlation with WHO grade, and higher ASPHD1 expression was associated with prolonged OS; multivariable Cox models identified low ASPHD1 as an independent adverse prognostic factor. Pan-cancer analysis further revealed that higher ASPHD1 expression was associated with longer OS in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), uveal melanoma (UVM), and mesothelioma (MESO). In glioma cell lines, ASPHD1 overexpression suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous U87 xenograft model. ASPHD1 overexpression also upregulated neuronal differentiation–related genes, produced more negative resting membrane potentials on whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, enhanced depolarization-evoked Ca 2+ transients on calcium imaging, and increased NeuN protein expression. Discussion Together, these findings identify ASPHD1 as a favorable prognostic biomarker in glioma and suggest that high ASPHD1 expression restrains glioma progression while promoting neuron-like differentiation of glioma cells.</p></details> |  |

The classification is a collection of polygons for tree crowns, stored as a geopackage file (gpkg). This dataset covers all tree canopy in the city (i.e., wall-to-wall), with canopy cover current for 2021. There are classification predictions for 1,806,811 tree crowns, with additional crowns inserted from reference street tree database data (for 1,821,184 total labeled) into the source tree crown polygon dataset (2,127,625 total crowns, the difference being unclassified due to incomplete data). The overall accuracy is 81.5% (kappa = 0.788) In the Genus_Predicted column, each crown is classified as one of 18 common, dominant deciduous tree genera present in the city, based on Nowak et al. (2018) and Treglia et al. (2021). There are many more (hundreds) of tree species in the city, and this is restricted to the genus level for the most common genera because of limitations in the separability with the XGBoost classifier. Included genera are: Acer (maple) Ailanthus (tree of heaven) Betula (birch) Fraxinus (ash) Ginkgo (ginkgo) Gleditsia (honeylocust) Liquidambar (sweetgum) Liriodendron (tuliptree) Malus (apple) Platanus (London planetree and sycamore) Prunus (cherry) Pyrus (pear) Quercus (oak) Robinia (black locust) Styphnolobium (pagoda tree) Tilia (linden) Ulmus (elm) Zelkova (zelkova) However, where a single valid street tree database point intersects with a tree crown object, we include this reference value in the Genus_Ref column (as well as Species_Ref, FullCultivar_Ref, and other information from the street tree database). Where available, we merge the genus label from the street tree database into the labeled classification, superseding any predicted classification label; this is stored in the Genus_Merged column. This includes many more genera than we were able to map with the classifier. In normal usage, we recommend using the Genus_Merged column.

| **[Ephrin Receptors and Ephrin Ligands in Uveal Melanoma: A Big Data Analysis Using Web Resources](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms27010442)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uveal melanoma (UVM) is a rare cancer that represents the second most common melanoma (after the cutaneous) and the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite recent advances in the understanding of UVM pathogenesis, its prognosis remains unchanged, with half of patients dying because of liver metastasis. Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptors (EPHs) constitute the largest known family of tyrosine receptors, and, along with their ligands, EFNs, regulate key physiological processes and are implicated in cancer pathogenesis. In this study, we used open-access web bioinformatics platforms to explore and analyze big datasets provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) UVM cohort of patients. We profiled the genomic alterations present in a subset of UVM patients, highlighting a likely pathogenic deep deletion of EPHA7. Survival analysis showed that overexpression levels of EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA8, EPHB2, and EFNB2 are significantly associated with poor overall survival. Additionally, high expression levels of EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA7, EPHA8, EPHB2, EFNA2, and EFNB2 correlate with reduced progression-free interval and disease-free survival. Finally, we identified the EPHs (EPHA2, EPHA4, EPHA8, and EPHB4) and EFNs (EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA4, and EFNB2) that are significantly overexpressed in the aggressive epithelioid histological subtype and revealed that the majority of EPHs/EFNs are overexpressed in metastatic disease. In conclusion, our results highlight that a subset of EPHs and EFNs may be associated with worse clinical outcomes (EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA7, EPHA8, EPHB2, EFNA2, and EFNB2), and an aggressive histological subtype (EPHA2, EPHA4, EPHA8, EPHB4, EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA4, and EFNB2). The potential correlation of these genes with clinicopathological parameters of UVM need to be evaluated and validated with bioinformatic and experimental approaches in well-characterized cohorts of UVM patients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of Tuber melanosporum Using Optoelectronic Technology](https://doi.org/10.3390/s26010230)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuber melanosporum, the black truffle, is a fungus of high economic and ecological value, but its underground detection remains a challenge due to the lack of reliable, non-invasive methods. This study presents the development and proof of concept of a portable optoelectronic nose that integrates nine optical sensors and one electrochemical sensor for the in vitro identification of T. melanosporum. The optical sensors use colorimetric and fluorogenic molecular indicators supported on UVM-7, alumina, and silica. Tests were performed with truffles at different depths and in the presence of soil and compost to evaluate the device’s multi-source response. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models showed robust discrimination between soil, compost, and truffles, with an accuracy of 0.91 under most conditions. Detection at 30 cm showed an accuracy of 0.94, confirming the system’s ability to differentiate between sample types. Performance improved in simplified scenarios based on the presence or absence of truffles. Furthermore, the artificial neural network models achieved optimal results in binary classification. Taken together, the results support the system’s potential as an accurate, non-invasive tool with possible application to the agronomic management of truffle orchards.</p></details> |  |

While local treatments like surgery or radiation can control primary tumors, nearly half of patients die from metastasis. Our aim was identifying potential pathways involved in resistance to targeted therapy in UVM. Methods: Here, we screened 100 pathway-activating mutant complementary DNAs by lentiviral overexpression to identify those that enhance the survival of cancer cells in the presence of clinically relevant targeted therapies, using BAP1 wild-type UVM cells and validated the most significant results in BAP1-mutant cells. Results: This revealed JAK/STAT activation, overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL2/BCL-XL, and dysregulated PI3K/mTOR or Hippo pathways as escape routes under MEK-ERK or FAK inhibition. Bioinformatic analysis of UVM transcriptome in TCGA further showed that high expression of the hallmark PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and IL6/JAK/STAT signaling correlates with poor prognosis. A similar correlation was shown by YAP and anti-apoptotic signatures. The analysis of individual representative genes from these signatures revealed that MTOR, BCL2L1 (BCL-XL), and TEAD4 gene expression are linked to poorer survival, underscoring the potential clinical impact of these adaptive pathways. Proliferation and apoptosis assay demonstrated that aberrant activation of AKT and YAP promotes resistance to FAK and MEK inhibitors. Conclusions: These findings support the adaptability of UVM lesions and suggest rational combination therapies targeting both primary GNAQ/GNA11-driven oncogenic signals and their compensatory networks as a more effective, personalized treatment approach for advanced UVM.</p></details> |  |

Diese stützen den Körper, sollen dem Fortschreiten der Asymmetrien entgegenwirken und einen Haltungskollaps verhindern. Aufgrund des zeitintensiven Herstellungsverfahrens und der mangelnden Anpassbarkeit bei körperlichen Veränderungen, sind diese komplexen Sitze für Kinder und Jugendliche keine zufriedenstellende Lösung. Eine Alternative sind modulare Sitzsysteme, welche jedoch bei starken Deformationen unzureichende Individualisierungsmöglichkeiten bieten. Ziel des SITiNs ist es daher, die Versorgung junger RollstuhlfahrerInnen mit einem anpassbaren Individualsitz zu verbessern, der eine regelmäßige Adaption an den jugendlichen Körper bei lokalen TherapeutInnen zulässt. Damit sollen die Mobilität und Versorgung der Heranwachsenden nachhaltig verbessert, der Versorgungspfad verkürzt und die Kosten für das Gesundheitssystem signifikant gesenkt werden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating multiple key molecules in uveal melanoma to uncover metastatic and immune microenvironment-related gene signatures](https://doi.org/10.18240/ijo.2026.01.02)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIM: To identify metastasis-associated prognostic genes and construct a robust molecular signature for survival prediction in uveal melanoma (UVM) patients. METHODS: Transcriptomic data and clinical information from 80 UVM patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-UVM cohort and an external Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray dataset (GSE73652; 8 non-metastatic vs 5 metastatic cases) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and survival analyses identified seven metastasis- and prognosis-related genes. Their expression was further examined using public single-cell RNA-seq data (GSE139829; 11 tumors). Experimental validation was performed in UVM cell lines (92.1, OMM1, MEL270) and adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting to confirm transcriptomic trends. A LASSO Cox model was applied to construct a metastasis-related risk Score signature. Tumor immune microenvironment characteristics were evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATE. Somatic mutation and copy number variation (CNV) profiles were also examined. RESULTS: Seven key genes (UBE2T, KIF20A, DLGAP5, KLC3, TPX2, UBE2C, AURKA) were significantly associated with overall survival and used to construct a metastasis-related riskScore signature, which effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups and served as an independent prognostic factor. qRT-PCR and Western blot results confirmed that the expression levels of selected key genes in UVM cell lines showed significant differences compared to ARPE-19 cells, which were largely consistent with the transcriptomic findings. The high-risk group exhibited reduced immune infiltration and stromal activity. Single-cell analysis revealed these genes were predominantly expressed in a tumor cell cluster characterized by BAP1 loss and high metastatic potential. Mutation and CNV analyses further supported the relevance of these genes to UVM progression. CONCLUSION: This study establishes and validates a seven-gene signature associated with metastasis and prognosis in UVM. The findings provide a framework for understanding molecular determinants of tumor progression and immune microenvironment alterations, and may offer guidance for future mechanistic studies and therapeutic exploration.</p></details> |  |

While serial robotic arms have been widely adopted in UVMS applications due to their operational flexibility, their inherent structural characteristics present certain challenges in underwater environments. These challenges primarily stem from the cumulative effects of joint mechanisms and dynamic interactions with the fluid medium. In this context, we explore an innovative UVMS solution that incorporates the Delta parallel mechanism, which offers distinct advantages through its symmetrical architecture and unilateral motor configuration, particularly in maintaining operational stability. We develop a comprehensive framework that includes mechanical design optimization, implementation of distributed control systems, and formulation of closed-form kinematic models, with comparative analysis against conventional serial robotic arms. Experimental validation demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in underwater navigation, target acquisition, and object manipulation under operator-guided control. The results reveal substantial enhancements in motion consistency and gravitational stability compared to traditional serial-arm configurations, positioning the Delta-based UVMS as a viable solution for complex underwater manipulation tasks. Furthermore, this study provides a comparative analysis of the proposed Delta-based UVMS and conventional serial-arm systems, offering valuable design insights and performance benchmarks to inform future development and optimization of underwater manipulation technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIFT: A Scalable Methodology for LLM Accelerator Fault Assessment using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09829)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The massive scale of modern AI accelerators presents critical challenges to traditional fault assessment methodologies, which face prohibitive computational costs and provide poor coverage of critical failure modes. This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \textbf{2.2$\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \textbf{99\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \textbf{12.8$\times$} improvement in \textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection. RIFT automatically generates UVM-compliant verification artifacts, ensuring its findings are directly actionable and integrable into commercial RTL verification workflows.</p></details> |  |

Methods Multi-omics data from TCGA, CGGA, GTEx, cBioPortal, and ROC Plotter were analyzed to assess UCP family expression patterns, prognostic significance, biological functions, immune cell infiltration, and genetic alterations across various cancers. In vitro experiments were carried out to assess UCP2’s impact on glioblastoma (GBM) aggressive traits and apoptosis. Results UCP2 demonstrated significant overexpression in most malignancies, whereas other UCP family members showed reduced expression. High UCP2 expression is a prognostic risk factor for KIRP, LGG, and UVM, while it has protective effects in CESC, OV, SARC, and SKCM.

Tuttavia, nell’ambiente spaziale è fondamentale garantire l’integrità delle informazioni ed evitare malfunzionamenti, poiché le architetture installate sui satelliti sono esposte a guasti indotti dalle radiazioni che possono compromettere l’intero sistema. Le tecniche di mitigazione, hardware e software, costituiscono quindi un livello essenziale di protezione. Sulla base di queste motivazioni, questo lavoro studia come applicare in modo sistematico tecniche di mitigazione degli effetti radiativi sviluppando una nuova metodologia per l’analisi delle architetture digitali e l’identificazione delle soluzioni più adatte ad aumentarne la resilienza e l'affidabilità. La metodologia è stata applicata a una Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) sviluppata presso l’Università di Pisa. È stata condotta un’analisi approfondita della CGRA, valutando criticità, area e consumo di potenza dei principali blocchi. Sono state selezionate le tecniche di mitigazione con il miglior compromesso tra costi e protezione, e proposta una soluzione personalizzata che sfrutta la configurabilità dell’architettura, permettendo l’attivazione dei meccanismi di fault tolerance anche a runtime. Infine, il core è stato validato mediante un ambiente UVM dedicato e testbench specifici. I risultati di frequenza massima, potenza e area sono stati ottenuti tramite sintesi standard-cell e verificati con analisi post-sintesi e un test di iniezione di guasti sviluppato presso l'Università di Pisa. Nowadays, reconfigurable hardware architectures play a key role in space systems thanks to their adaptability and efficiency. However, in the orbital environment it is essential to preserve information integrity and prevent malfunctions, since the architectures deployed on satellites are exposed to radiation-induced faults that may compromise the entire system. Hardware and software mitigation techniques therefore provide an essential protection layer. Based on these motivations, this work investigates how radiation-mitigation techniques can be systematically applied by developing a new methodology for analyzing digital architectures and identifying the most suitable solutions to increase their resilience and reliability. The methodology was applied to a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) developed at the University of Pisa. A detailed analysis of the CGRA was carried out, evaluating the criticality, area, and power consumption of its main blocks. Mitigation techniques offering the best trade-off between resource usage and fault protection were identified, and a customized solution was proposed that leverages the configurability of the architecture, enabling fault-tolerance mechanisms to be activated even at runtime. Finally, the core was validated through a dedicated UVM environment and specific testbenches. Maximum clock frequency, power, and area results were obtained through standard-cell synthesis and further verified via post-synthesis analysis and a fault-injection test developed at the University of Pisa.</p></details> |  |

We investigated whether proteins governing endocytosis and signaling, including Megalin (LRP2), Cubilin (CUBN), Caveolin-1, GAIP-interacting protein C-terminus 1 (GIPC1), and Disabled homolog 2-interacting protein (DAB2IP), exhibit subtype-specific expression patterns in ocular tumors and whether these patterns are related to transcriptomic profiles and survival. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human ocular tissues included controls (n = 10), retinoblastoma (n = 10), and UM subtypes (epithelioid, spindle, mixoid; total n = 30). Immunofluorescence for LRP2, CUBN, CAV1, GIPC1, and DAB2IP was quantified using ImageJ (version 1.54g) across standardized high-power fields; per-specimen means were used for statistical analysis (Shapiro–Wilk test; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test). Public data analyses comprised: (i) overall survival in TCGA-UVM using GEPIA2; (ii) differential expression in GEO datasets (GSE62075: melanocytes vs. UM cell lines; GSE208143: retinoblastoma vs. pediatric control retina) and (iii) multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis using the GEPIA3 online platform. Results: LRP2 expression was uniformly reduced across retinoblastoma and all UM subtypes versus control. CUBN expression decreased in retinoblastoma and epithelioid melanoma, was retained in spindle melanoma, and increased in mixoid-cell melanoma. CAV1 expression was increased in epithelioid melanoma but reduced in retinoblastoma, mixoid, and spindle melanomas. GIPC1 and DAB2IP expression were preserved in epithelioid melanoma yet significantly reduced in retinoblastoma and mixoid/spindle melanomas. In TCGA-UVM, higher CAV1 and GIPC1 mRNA expression was associated with worse overall survival (p ≈ 0.025 and 0.036), whereas LRP2, CUBN, and DAB2IP expression were not significant. GEO analyses revealed no significant differences for the five genes in UM cell lines versus melanocytes (GSE62075). However, in retinoblastoma (GSE208143), LRP2 was downregulated, while CUBN, CAV1, GIPC1, and DAB2IP were upregulated. Conclusions: Endocytic/signaling proteins exhibit distinct, subtype-linked expression in ocular tumors. Integration with public datasets highlights CAV1 and GIPC1 as adverse survival correlates in UM and positions LRP2/CUBN/DAB2IP dysregulation as features of ocular tumor biology, nominating candidate biomarkers and mechanistic targets.</p></details> |  |

Methods Utilizing bulk RNA-seq (TCGA/GTEx/CPTAC), immune deconvolution, proteomics, and functional enrichment, we analyzed UBD expression, survival prognosis, immune infiltration, and molecular pathways across 33 cancers. Molecular docking and MD simulations were performed to assess UBD-protein interactions. Through lentivirus-mediated overexpression, functional assays (CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell), transcriptome sequencing, and biochemical validation, we demonstrated that UBD promotes malignant phenotypes in esophageal cancer via the TP53 signaling pathway. Results UBD was upregulated in 14 cancers but downregulated in thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and kidney chromophobe (KICH). ROC analysis highlighted UBD’s diagnostic potential (AUC &amp;gt;0.8 in gastrointestinal tumors). High UBD conferred protection in melanoma (SKCM, HR = 0.891) and sarcoma (SARC, HR = 0.899) but predicted poor outcomes in uveal melanoma (UVM, HR = 1.298) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD, HR = 1.143).UBD positively correlated with the IFN-γ-dominant immune subtype (C2), characterized by CD8+ T cells/M1 macrophages. Drug sensitivity profiling nominated imatinib (Vina score: -8.9 kcal/mol) and TTNPB as potential therapies for UBD-high tumors, validated by stable MD simulations. In esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), UBD expression escalated with tumor stage and predicted poor survival (p&amp;lt;0.05).UBD enhances the proliferation and migration of esophageal cancer cells by modulating the TP53 signaling pathway, as validated through transcriptomic analysis and functional assays. Conclusions This study advances UBD as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target, bridging molecular insights with clinical translation in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive analysis using bioinformatics tools and experimental validations, examining RBP expression profiles across cancer types based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We employed survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier method and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the roles of RBP4 and RBP7 in the tumor microenvironment. Results: Our analysis revealed significant downregulation of RBPs in multiple cancers, with RBP4 and RBP7 showing notable expression variations linked to tumor stages and grades. Cox analysis identified RBP4 as a protective gene in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and mesothelioma (MESO), while RBP7 exhibited protective effects in breast cancer (BRCA) and uveal melanoma (UVM). Conclusions: This pan-cancer and single-cell integrative analysis highlights the complex roles of RBPs in cancer progression and their potential as prognostic biomarkers, particularly RBP4 and RBP7 in breast cancer.

| **[Data Sheet 1_Pan-cancer landscape of UBD/FAT10 and experimental validation in esophageal carcinoma.docx](https://openalex.org/W7111071545)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective To comprehensively characterize the pan-cancer roles of Ubiquitin D (UBD/FAT10) in tumorigenesis, immune regulation, and therapeutic response through integrative multi-omics and expe+rimental analyses. Methods Utilizing bulk RNA-seq (TCGA/GTEx/CPTAC), immune deconvolution, proteomics, and functional enrichment, we analyzed UBD expression, survival prognosis, immune infiltration, and molecular pathways across 33 cancers. Molecular docking and MD simulations were performed to assess UBD-protein interactions. Through lentivirus-mediated overexpression, functional assays (CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell), transcriptome sequencing, and biochemical validation, we demonstrated that UBD promotes malignant phenotypes in esophageal cancer via the TP53 signaling pathway. Results UBD was upregulated in 14 cancers but downregulated in thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and kidney chromophobe (KICH). ROC analysis highlighted UBD’s diagnostic potential (AUC >0.8 in gastrointestinal tumors). High UBD conferred protection in melanoma (SKCM, HR = 0.891) and sarcoma (SARC, HR = 0.899) but predicted poor outcomes in uveal melanoma (UVM, HR = 1.298) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD, HR = 1.143).UBD positively correlated with the IFN-γ-dominant immune subtype (C2), characterized by CD8+ T cells/M1 macrophages. Drug sensitivity profiling nominated imatinib (Vina score: -8.9 kcal/mol) and TTNPB as potential therapies for UBD-high tumors, validated by stable MD simulations. In esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), UBD expression escalated with tumor stage and predicted poor survival (p<0.05).UBD enhances the proliferation and migration of esophageal cancer cells by modulating the TP53 signaling pathway, as validated through transcriptomic analysis and functional assays. Conclusions This study advances UBD as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target, bridging molecular insights with clinical translation in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |

Conventional verification methods, particularly traditional directed testbenches, are often plagued by scalability, reusability, and adequate functional coverage issues. In order to solve these problems, this project is designed to enhance the AXI protocol verification process through the development of a UVM-based verification environment for an AXI slave interface. With the integration of constrained-random stimulus generation and coverage-driven methods, the UVM testbench ensures extensive validation across a variety of test cases, including increment and wrap bursts with different beat lengths (4, 8, and 16). The shift from a traditional testbench to the UVM-based approach not only makes verification easy but also improves accuracy, effectiveness of debugging, and coverage exponentially. Through methodical testing and validation, the enhanced environment tests UVM's capability to implement a stable, reusable, and scalable solution for AXI protocol verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Identifies Glycosphingolipid Signature Linking Immune Dysregulation and Clinical Prognosis in Uveal Melanoma](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7815940/v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p><title>Abstract</title> Purpose To investigate glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (GSB) dysregulation in uveal melanoma (UVM) and develop a machine learning-driven prognostic signature bridging GSB activity, tumor microenvironment, and clinical outcomes. Methods Using TCGA and GEO cohorts, GSB activity was quantified via Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). Differential expression analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and Cox regression were used to identify prognostic GSB-related genes and establish the glycosphingolipid biosynthetic risk score (GBRS). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and C-index were used to evaluate GBRS. Immune infiltration was assessed using ssGSEA and ESTIMATE algorithms. Drug sensitivity (IC50) correlations were evaluated via oncoPredict. Results We uncovered pervasive GSB dysregulation across cancer types, with GSB score showing superior prognostic accuracy to traditional clinical variables in UVM. An eight-gene prognostic signature was identified and refined to a three-gene GBRS comprising CA12, SLC44A3, and BHLHA15. GBRS independently predicted overall survival and demonstrated predictive value for disease-specific survival, progression-free interval, and metastasis-free survival. GBRS correlated positively with CD8 <sup>+</sup> T cell and M2-like macrophage infiltration. Meta-analysis confirmed CA12 as a significant prognostic risk factor, with sphingolipid/glycosphingolipid synthesis pathways enriched in its co-expressed genes. Conclusions GBRS is a robust prognostic biomarker for UVM, reflecting immune dysregulation and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Translational Relevance : This study provides a clinically applicable GSB-derived signature that improves risk stratification and guides therapy selection for UVM patients.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional centralized models, while energy efficient, often face challenges related to data integrity and security. This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-based architecture aimed at enhancing secure IoT data processing at the base station while preserving energy efficiency. The system utilizes a blockchain network among sink nodes and its operation is divided into four stages: deployment of a virtual machine on leaf nodes for real-time data collection, generation of hash keys to ensure secure transmission to sink nodes, implementation of a universal virtual machine (UVM) at the sink layer for block formation, and development of an integrated authentication and consensus module within the UVM. The proposed framework ensures efficient, verifiable and efficient data handling. Performance is evaluated using sensor node energy efficiency (SNEN), blockchain energy consumption level (BCLE), blockchain transmission efficiency (BCTE), and packet delivery in sink nodes (PDSN). Experimental results demonstrate improved energy efficiency in the sensor zone, reduced blockchain latency, and improved throughput, establishing a robust and secure model for data handling in PWSNs.</p></details> |  |

The article approaches the struggle to maintain efficiency and thoroughness against increasingly heterogeneous architectures integrating diverse processing elements, accelerators, and high-speed interconnects. This technical article presents an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning-driven framework that fundamentally transforms UVM verification workflows by embedding intelligent automation, adaptive learning, and autonomous decision-making capabilities throughout the verification lifecycle. The proposed system leverages multiple AI paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning algorithms implementing Proximal Policy Optimization and Deep Q-Networks for adaptive stimulus generation that learns optimal testing strategies through interaction with designs under verification, supervised ensemble learning models combining gradient boosting and neural networks for predictive coverage trajectory forecasting, and unsupervised learning techniques employing Variational Autoencoders with density-based clustering for automated failure triage and root cause inference. Implementation on production-grade FPGA-based SoC environments featuring high-speed network controllers, storage interfaces, and interconnect fabrics demonstrates substantial improvements across multiple dimensions. The framework achieves significant acceleration in coverage closure timelines, dramatic reduction in debug effort through intelligent failure categorization and automated root cause summarization, and notable decrease in computational resource consumption while maintaining or exceeding verification quality metrics compared to traditional manual methodologies. The modular architecture ensures extensibility to emerging verification challenges, including mixed-signal validation, formal property checking, power-aware simulation, and security verification, with the incorporation of Explainable AI techniques providing transparency into automated decision-making processes essential for safety-critical and certified environments. Transfer learning policies allow policies trained on similar designs to serve well on new verification platforms with little or no additional training needs, which is many times faster to deploy than training policies in semiconductor product lines. The framework is a paradigm shift of tool-assisted verification to AI-assisted autonomous verification systems that continuously learn, evolve, and optimize through project lifecycles, which puts intelligent automation as a necessary feature of maintaining semiconductor innovation and first-silicon success in successive generations of more and more complex System-on-Chip implementations.</p></details> |  |

En af årsagerne tilskrives brug af digitale medier, hvilket inkluderer sociale medier (SoMe) som Instagram og Snapchat samt gaming, hvor spil som Fortnite, Roblox og Counter Strike oftest spilles alene hjemme eller sammen med andre i gamingklubber. Det er især den psykiske og sociale mistrivsel der bliver italesat, men også den fysisk mistrivsel med for lidt søvn og for lidt bevægelse udgør en vigtig faktor for børns trivsel (se fx Gao et al., 2024; Khan &amp; Burton, 2021; McInroy &amp; Mishna, 2017).<br/>I dette oplæg vil der være fokus på hvordan fysisk aktiviteter, der relaterer sig til børn og unges gaming og dets univers på en meningsfuld, relevant og sjov måde kan integreres i deres træning, og hvordan aktiviteterne kan forstås som en trivselsfremmende indsats blandt børn og unge, der gamer. Med afsæt i agential realisme (Barad, 2007) og baseret på observationer indsamlet i esportsklubber, fritidsklubber og gamingklubber, beskrives to fortællinger kreeret som creative non-fiction. De to fortællinger illustrerer, hvordan fysisk aktivitet med fokus på glæde, begejstring og sjove gaming-relaterede oplevelser kan virker trivselsfremmende, og hvordan aktiviteterne både kan opstå spontant og kan understøttes af pædagoger, lærere eller andre der faciliterer gaming for børn og unge. Dette kan f.eks. ske som en respons på uro eller som en aktiv pause, der integrerer elementer fra gamingens univers for at gøre aktiviteten nærværende og motiverende for målgruppen.<br/>Jeg ønsker afsluttende at diskutere hvordan gaming kan inddrages som element i bevægelsesundervisning, såsom idræt, i enten folkeskolen, gymnasialeuddannelser eller på videregående uddannelser.

Despite the emergence of numerous local treatment modalities for UM in recent years, such as brachytherapy and proton beam radiotherapy, the prognosis of this disease remains suboptimal. RNA modification, which pertains to diverse chemical modifications on RNA molecules, plays a pivotal role in modulating gene expression and maintaining cell functions. N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the first reported mRNA acetylation regulator, can be activated in various cancers. However, the function of NAT10 in UVM remains elusive. In the present study, by integrating the gene expression information and clinical data from the TCGA database, we employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to screen genes related to NAT10 and subsequently constructed a model thereon. Through Cox proportional hazards model and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis, a signature of NAT10-related genes (NRGs) was generated. This prediction model was established based on four specific NRGs, namely TRIM47, ISG20, CEBPB, and ATG9A. Additionally, via Gene Ontology (GO) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we identified the disparities in its biological functions and signaling pathways and further investigated the relationship between immune infiltrations. In summary, the findings of this study may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for UVM, thereby laying the foundation for the precision medicine of patients.</p></details> |  |

Methods: In this bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study, we analyzed the causal relationships between nine common chronic inflammatory diseases and UVM using summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The analysis included 342 UVM cases and 378,749 controls from the FinnGen database. For inflammatory diseases, GWAS summary data were obtained from large-scale studies involving up to 484,598 individuals. Functional validation was performed through transcriptomic analysis. Key genes were identified through protein–protein interaction network construction and enrichment analyses, followed by survival analysis to evaluate the association of genes with patient prognosis. Results: The forward MR analysis revealed a significant causal relationship between Crohn’s disease (CD) and UVM (odds ratio = 1.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.0–1.4, P &lt; 0.05). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the results, with no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy. In reverse MR analysis, UVM showed no significant causal effect on chronic inflammatory diseases. Protein–protein interaction and functional enrichment analyses identified CARD9 and TNFSF15 as potential key genes, and survival analysis revealed that their expression levels were significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with UVM ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: This study confirmed through MR analysis that CD was a potential risk factor for UVM. Additionally, CARD9 and TNFSF15 were identified as key genes closely associated with patient prognosis, providing new evidence for the pathogenic mechanisms of UVM. These findings were of significant importance for the prevention and control of UVM risk in patients with chronic inflammation, as well as for the development of personalized treatment strategies.</p></details> |  |

Although implicated in many malignancies, its pan-cancer prognostic value and therapeutic prospects are unknown. Methods : Multiple-omics analysis was performed on TCGA, CPTAC, and GEO datasets. Tools included TIMER2 (immune infiltration), GEPIA2 (survival/pathological staging), cBioPortal (genomic changes), UALCAN (methylation), and STRING (protein interactions). Drug sensitivity correlations were evaluated using GSCALite and CTRP. Key Results Expression characteristics: B2M is highly expressed in CHOL, GBM, and KIRC, while it is lowly expressed in COAD and LUAD (P&lt;0.001). Prognostic value: High B2M expression is significantly associated with poor prognosis in LGG and UVM (OS: P&lt;0.001), but is associated with better survival in KIRC (P=0.043). Genetic variation: B2M has the highest mutation frequency (&gt;20%) in DLBC, mainly consisting of L15Ffs * 41 truncated mutations. Immune regulation: B2M expression is positively correlated with CD8+T cell and Tregs infiltration, and significantly correlated with TMB and MSI . Functional pathway: B2M regulates tumor immunity through JAK-STAT and NOD like receptor signaling pathways, and its interacting genes (HLA-A/B/C, etc.) are significantly enriched in MHC-I complex function (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion : As a pan cancer biomarker, the expression level of B2M is closely related to prognosis, immune microenvironment and treatment response, and may become a new target of immunotherapy. This study provides a theoretical basis for the individualized treatment of cancer, but further experiments are needed to verify its mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Traditional verification processes tend to break RTL functional verification and embedded software validation into independent processes causing blind spots to surface late in the silicon lifecycle. The following paper describes a simple way of including C-based software tests into UVM-based hardware testbenches to provide unified stimulus generation, better coverage closure and more realistic corner-case verification. We outline the infrastructure needed, the way promising virtual registers are designed, and how the means of synchronization with their help are achieved so as to enable coherent HW-Software co-verification.

| **[YWHAZ-Mediated Modulation of Tumor Differentiation Impact on the Long-Term Prognosis in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients Following Chemoradiotherapy](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7457530/v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p><title>Abstract</title> Objective To investigate the correlation between the expression of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta ( <italic>YWHAZ</italic> ) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and tumor progression, and to analyze the mediating effect of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> on the association between the degree of tumor differentiation and prognosis in esophageal cancer patients. Method Expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> gene between 33 cancers and normal, overall survival (OS) between groups with low <italic>YWHAZ</italic> expression and high <italic>YWHAZ</italic> expression were analyzed by bioinformatic analysis with TCGA-GTEx dataset, comparison of <italic>YWHAZ e</italic> xpression between esophageal cancer (ESCA) and normal subjects, correlations between expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> and different cancer stages, survival in patients with ESCA were analyzed by bioinformatic analysis with TCGA-ESCA dataset. Then an immunohistochemical assay was used to detect the expression rate of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> in 75 cases with ESCC after chemoradiotherapy. Correlation between the expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> and tumor progression, including OS and progression-free survival (PFS), were analyzed using the rank sum test or chi-square test. Cox regression, general linear model (GLM) and mediation analyses were used to analyze the effect of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> expression on the long-term prognosis of ESCC patients. Results Bioinformatic analysis with TCGA-GTEx dataset found expression levels of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> in BRCA, CESC, COAD, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, OV, PAAD, READ, STAD, THYM were higher than those in normal subjects ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). OS in KIRP, LGG, LIHC, LUAD, PAAD and UVM with high expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> were shorter than those with low expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05-0.0005), while it was longer in KIRC with high expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> than that with low expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> ( <italic>P =</italic> 0.048). Expression level of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> was higher in ESCA than that in normal subjects in TCGA data ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and it was higher in ESCC than that in esophageal adenocarcinoma ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). It was higher in Asian ESCA patients than that in Caucasian and Africa-american ESCA patients ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). There were no differences about expression level of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> among different cancer stages ( <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). OS and PFS of ESCA in patients with low expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> were the same as patients with high expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> ( <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), but effect of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> expression level interacted with tumor grade on ESCA patients survival differed from each other ( <italic>P</italic> = 0.023). The expression rate of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> in carcinoma tissues with ESCC (0.59 vs 0.49) was significantly higher than that in anastomotic stomas (z = 2.692, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007). High expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> was a risk factor for long-term recurrence/disease progression (HR = 3.166, 95% CI: 1.623–6.176, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and death (HR = 6.321, 95% CI: 2.925–13.658, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in patients. GLM analysis found expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> interacted with tumor differentiation grade negatively correlated with OS in ESCC (B=-6.058, 95%CI:-9.233~-2.893, <italic>x</italic> <sup>2</sup> = 14.076, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). <italic>YWHAZ</italic> expression served as a mediator of the association between the grade of tumor differentiation and OS or PFS in ESCC patients ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The indirect effect (mediating role) of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> expression accounted for 62.15% of the total effect of the grade of tumor differentiation on OS, and accounted for 47.39% of the total effect of the grade of tumor differentiation on PFS. Conclusion High expression of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> , which mediates the grade of tumor differentiation, is a risk factor for long-term recurrence/disease progression and death in patients with ESCC after chemoradiotherapy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Formal Verification-Based Identification of Low-Probability Corner Cases](https://doi.org/10.57237/j.cst.2025.04.002)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of information technology, the complexity of chip design continues to increase, with highly coupled internal data paths and control logic as well as sharply rising integration density in System-on-Chip (SoC), which impose greater demands on verification methodologies. Traditional approaches show inherent limitations in scalability, reusability, and platform standardization, making it difficult to efficiently achieve comprehensive coverage of all chip behaviors within limited resources. Although large-scale automated tools and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) have been widely adopted to enhance random testing and regression simulation, they still fail to efficiently capture extreme boundary scenarios that may lead to fatal failures, leaving potential blind spots in verification. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hybrid verification method that combines dynamic simulation with Formal Property Verification (FPV), using the critical path of the PWR module as an example for analysis. A UVM-based verification platform is constructed to execute randomized test cases on key functions and typical scenarios, achieving more than 94% coverage in line, toggle, branch, and functional metrics, which confirms the completeness of basic functional validation but also indicates the difficulty of covering corner cases. Then, FPV is applied by formulating property assertions, such as state transition constraints, and performing exhaustive mathematical analysis of the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, thereby detecting extremely low-probability boundary conditions and revealing implicit usage restrictions in design logic. By incorporating these restrictions into formal constraints, the verification results are corrected and latent design defects are confirmed. This hybrid method effectively leverages the complementary strengths of UVM dynamic simulation and FPV formal analysis, significantly improving the detection capability of corner cases, enhancing verification completeness and efficiency, and strengthening design reliability, while also providing a theoretical basis and practical reference for optimizing verification strategies in future SoC design projects. 随着信息快速发展，芯片设计复杂度持续攀升，内部数据通路与控制逻辑高度耦合，片上系统（SoC）集成密度急剧增加。传统验证方法学在扩展、复用及平台标准化等方面存在局限，难以在有限资源内实现对全部芯片行为高效覆盖。尽管已有研究借助大规模自动化工具，通过通用验证方法学（UVM）增强随机测试与回归仿真，仍难以在项目周期内高效覆盖可能引发致命故障的极端边界场景，致使验证存在盲区。本文提出一种动态仿真与形式验证（FPV）相结合的混合验证方法，以PWR模块的关键路径为例进行穷尽分析。首先，基于UVM构建动态仿真平台，通过随机测试对模块主要功能与常规场景进行验证，覆盖率达到94%以上；随后，采用FPV方法编写关键属性断言，对设计进行数学化分析，有效识别出UVM难以覆盖的边界条件，推导出设计中隐含的使用约束，进而揭示出潜在缺陷。实验表明，该方法高效发挥动态仿真与形式验证的互补优势，显著提升验证完备性和效率，为芯片设计可靠性提供有力保障。</p></details> |  |

Traditional verification approaches struggle to adequately address the unique challenges posed by Single Instruction, Multiple Thread execution models, dynamic thread scheduling, and complex interactions between compute units and multi-level cache systems. This article presents a comprehensive Universal Verification Methodology-based testbench architecture specifically designed for GPU compute unit verification, addressing critical gaps in existing verification practices through innovative SIMT-aware stimulus generation, integrated memory subsystem modeling, and scalable test generation frameworks. The proposed framework combines established UVM principles with GPU-specific verification techniques, creating a modular and reusable architecture that supports diverse configurations while maintaining systematic coverage collection and intelligent corner case detection. Extensive experimental evaluation across representative GPU workloads demonstrates substantial improvements in verification quality, debug efficiency, and development productivity compared to traditional approaches. The architecture's parameterized design enables seamless adaptation across different GPU generations while its extensible structure provides a foundation for future verification challenges, including AI accelerators and chiplet-based architectures.</p></details> |  |

| **[Targeting MCL‐1 to Overcome Therapeutic Resistance and Improve Cancer Mortality](https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.71390)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ABSTRACT Background Myeloid cell leukemia‐1 protein (MCL‐1) is a major anti‐apoptotic member of the Bcl‐2 family and is typically overexpressed in a broad range of malignancies, including non‐small‐cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and various solid tumors. By sequestering pro‐apoptotic effectors, MCL‐1 maintains mitochondrial stability and supports the tumor cell survival during stress, driving disease progression, therapeutic resistance, and ultimately, poor patient outcomes. In the last 10 years, the development of selective small‐molecule inhibitors of MCL‐1 has opened doors to enable the targeting of this mechanism of apoptosis avoidance. Discussion This perspective summarizes the current knowledge regarding the dual roles of MCL‐1 in apoptosis and mitochondrial homeostasis regulation. The structural foundations for the design of MCL‐1 inhibitors are revisited, the pharmacological profiles of the leading drugs (S63845, AZD5991, AMG 176) in advanced clinical development are summarized, and emerging strategies, such as combination therapies with inhibitors of anti‐apoptotic proteins such as BCL‐2, PROTAC strategies designed to degrade MCL‐1, and reversible‐binding chemotypes to maximize MCL‐1 inhibition and minimize toxicity, are reviewed. The non‐apoptotic roles of MCL‐1 in immune modulation and metabolism adaptation are also reviewed, along with the development of analytical methods to refine the patient selection process (e.g., BH3 profiling and transcriptomic signatures). The overexpression of MCL‐1 is associated with worse patient survival in ACC, CESC, ESCA, HNSC, LGG, and UVM cancers. Conclusion MCL‐1 is an exciting anti‐cancer target, and its inhibition may sensitize treatment‐resistant tumors to cell death and enhance patient survival. The key to clinical success will be to carefully develop more intensive dosing regimens, rationally combine agents, and develop trial designs that prioritize the evaluation of new agents that maximize antitumor activity without the risk of off‐target toxicities. Continued translational research and adaptive clinical trials are critical to fully realize the therapeutic potential of MCL‐1 inhibition across various cancer contexts.</p></details> |  |

UM exhibits unique molecular drivers, such as GNAQ/GNA11 mutations, and a distinct immune microenvironment. Despite these insights, the correlation and underlying mechanisms of lipid and cholesterol metabolism in UM development and progression have been scarcely investigated. Methods Single-cell data analysis and cellular communication analysis were employed to investigate the effect of cholesterol metabolism in UM and its relationship with cell-cell communication and tumor immunology. Single-cell data of UM were acquired from the GEO repository and analyzed using R software. Key genes associated with cholesterol metabolism were validated in vitro using the human metastatic uveal melanoma cell line C918 and MuM2B. Results Single-cell analysis revealed cellular heterogeneity in primary and metastatic UM samples. Metastatic UM tumor cells exhibited significantly lower cholesterol metabolism scores compared to primary tumor cells. Cell-cell communication analysis indicated that the Cho-high group demonstrated significantly higher levels of communication number and intensity. The APP-CD74 pathway was found to have relatively higher outgoing ligand-receptor communication in the Cho-high group. GSEA analysis found the mTORC1 signaling pathway and oxidative phosphorylation pathway is correlated to the cholesterol metabolism scores in melanoma cells in the UM dataset. Through correlation analysis and Cox regression, the gene SLC45A2 was identified as correlated with overall survival in both the TCGA-UVM dataset and the GSE84976. In vitro experiments showed that SLC45A2 depletion attenuated the metastatic and proliferative capacities of uveal melanoma cells. Conclusion Overall, this study provides the first single-cell level investigation of cholesterol metabolism in UM and identifies SLC45A2 as a potential key gene affecting UM progression by regulating cholesterol metabolism. These findings offer new perspectives on the role of cholesterol metabolism in UM and lay a foundation for future clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Constructing a Pan-Cancer Prognostic Model via Machine Learning Based on Immunogenic Cell Death Genes and Identifying NT5E as a Biomarker in Head and Neck Cancer](https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb47100812)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a specialized form of cell death that triggers antitumor immune responses. In tumors, ICD promotes the release of tumor-associated and tumor-specific antigens, thereby reshaping the immune microenvironment, restoring antitumor immunity, and facilitating tumor eradication. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ICD and its immunological effects vary across tumor types, and a comprehensive understanding remains limited. We systematically analyzed the expression of 34 ICD-related regulatory genes across 33 tumor types. Differential expression at the RNA, copy number variation (CNV), and DNA methylation levels was assessed in relation to clinical features. Associations between patient survival and RNA expression, CNVs, single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), and methylation were evaluated. Patients were stratified into immunological subtypes and further divided into high- and low-risk groups based on optimal prognostic models built using a machine learning framework. We explored the relationships between ICD-related genes and immune cell infiltration, stemness, heterogeneity, immune scores, immune checkpoint and regulatory genes, and subtype-specific expression patterns. Moreover, we examined the influence of immunotherapy and anticancer immune responses, applied three machine learning algorithms to identify prognostic biomarkers, and performed drug prediction and molecular docking analyses to nominate therapeutic targets. ICD-related genes were predominantly overexpressed in ESCA, GBM, KIRC, LGG, PAAD, and STAD. RNA expression of most ICD-related genes was associated with poor prognosis, while DNA methylation of these genes showed significant survival correlations in LGG and UVM. Prognostic models were successfully established for 18 cancer types, revealing intrinsic immune regulatory mechanisms of ICD-related genes. Machine learning identified several key prognostic biomarkers across cancers, among which NT5E emerged as a predictive biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), mediating tumor–immune interactions through multiple ligand–receptor pairs. This study provides a comprehensive view of ICD-related genes across cancers, identifies NT5E as a potential biomarker in HNSC, and highlights novel targets for predicting immunotherapy response and improving clinical outcomes in cancer patients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effect of Support and Polymer Modifier on the Catalytic Performance of Supported Palladium Catalysts in Hydrogenation](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30183820)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we investigated the influence of polymer nature and support characteristics on the performance of Pd-based heterogeneous catalysts. Catalysts were prepared via sequential adsorption of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) or chitosan (CS) and palladium ions onto MgO and SBA-15 supports under ambient conditions. The resulting hybrid materials were characterized by IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). TEM analysis revealed that Pd nanoparticles with an average size of 2–3 nm were well-dispersed on P4VP/MgO, while larger and less uniformly distributed particles (8–10 nm) were observed on SBA-15-based systems. Catalytic tests in the hydrogenation of 2-propen-1-ol, phenylacetylene, and 2-hexyn-1-ol under mild conditions (40 °C, 1 atm H2, ethanol) demonstrated that both the support and polymer type significantly influence activity and selectivity. P4VP-modified catalysts outperformed CS-containing analogs in all reactions. MgO-based systems showed higher activity and selectivity in 2-propen-1-ol hydrogenation compared to SBA-15-based catalysts. The 1%Pd–P4VP/MgO catalyst exhibited the best performance, with a reaction rate of 5.2 × 10−6 mol/s, 83.4% selectivity to propanol, and stable activity over 30 consecutive runs. In phenylacetylene and 2-hexyn-1-ol hydrogenation, all catalysts showed high selectivity to styrene (93–95%) and cis-2-hexen-1-ol (96–97%), respectively. The incorporation of P4VP polymer into the Pd/MgO catalyst leads to smaller and better-distributed palladium particles, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and stability during hydrogenation reactions. These results confirm that the choice of polymer modifier and inorganic support must be tailored to the specific reaction, enabling the design of highly active and selective polymer-modified Pd catalysts for selective hydrogenation processes under mild conditions.</p></details> |  |

While its role in adult hematologic malignancies is established, its implications for pediatric leukemia—particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)—remain underexplored. This review integrates transcriptomic, protein interaction, and immune correlation analyses to examine the dual role of SAMHD1 in pediatric hematological malignancies: as an antiviral restriction factor that impairs lentiviral gene therapy and as a therapeutic barrier that limits the efficacy of nucleoside analog‐based chemotherapy. We compare emerging transduction‐enhancing strategies, including Vpx delivery, SAMHD1 inhibition, and lipid nanoparticles, and evaluate their pediatric applicability. A conceptual schematic highlights the translational challenges unique to the developing immune and hematopoietic systems. Limitations of commonly used cellular models, such as THP‐1 cells, are discussed alongside the need for pediatric‐specific preclinical tools. We conclude by outlining a clinical translation roadmap and emphasizing the urgency of validating SAMHD1‐targeted strategies in pediatric trials to ensure their safety, efficacy, and integration into future treatment paradigms.</p></details> |  |

In this perspective, we discuss how oncostatin M (OSM) and its receptor OSMR regulate tumor cells as well as mesenchymal and endothelial cells, which are key components of hematopoietic stem cell and tumor stem cell niches, and how these mechanisms could explain the poor prognosis associated with high expression of OSM and OSMR in hematological and non-hematological malignancies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microarchitectural Malware Detection via Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) Events](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcp5030075)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work has shown that Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) data contains valuable behavioral information. Many existing methodologies rely on timing features or focus solely on workload classification. In this study, we propose a novel approach to malware classification using only TLB-related Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), explicitly excluding any dependence on timing features such as task execution duration or memory access timing. Our methodology evaluates whether TLB data alone, without any timing information, can effectively distinguish between malicious and benign programs. We test this across three classification scenarios: (1) A binary classification problem involving distinguishing malicious from benign tasks, (2) a 4-way classification problem designed to improve separability, and (3) a 10-way classification problem with classes of individual benign and malware tasks. Our results demonstrate that even without execution time or memory access timing, TLB events achieve up to 81% accuracy for the binary, and 72% accuracy for the 4-class grouping, and 61% accuracy for the 10-class grouping. These findings demonstrate that time-independent TLB patterns can serve as robust behavioral signatures. This work expands the understanding of microarchitectural side effects by demonstrating that TLB-only features, independent of timing-based techniques, can be effectively used for real-world malware detection.</p></details> |  |

The derivatives were subjected to 1H and 13C NMR and identified by comparison with the starting material. Ent-copalic acid and ent-β-acetoxycopalic acid were reisolated from copaiba oleoresin (a commercial sample) and identified by 1H NMR in comparison with the literature. For ent-copalic acid, a reaction study was performed to improve yields. Both were subjected to esterifications using the DCC/DMAP system, yielding three new semi-synthetic derivatives. After this, all derivatives and their respective starting materials were subjected to cytotoxic evaluation against a breast tumor cell line and against normal mammary gland cells. The results were very interesting, with the halogenated derivatives in the polyhaltic group showing great promise, with one of them showing similar toxicity to the positive control (activity parameter for the assay). For the copaltic group, the results showed that the active molecule fusion technique can lead to excellent results.</p></details> |  |

| **[Inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2 overcomes adaptive resistance to co-targeting of the protein kinase FAK and MEK in GNAQ-driven uveal melanoma](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2025.110712)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common eye cancer in adults, with 50% of patients developing overt metastasis that often proves fatal. The majority of UVM harbor mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, encoding constitutively active Gαq proteins. Combined inhibition of MEK and FAK downstream of Gαq has shown promising effects in UVM cells by inducing apoptotic cell death, but resistance to this strategy can occur in the clinic. Here, we aimed to identify new targets to overcome resistance to MEK + FAK inhibition (FAKi + MEKi). Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis in UVM cells treated with FAKi + MEKi showed increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as PUMA and BIM, which promoted cell death. However, we observed an adaptive increase in anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL2, upon FAK + MEK blockade. We generated UVM cells resistant to FAKi + MEKi by prolonged exposure. Whole-exome sequencing did not reveal relevant acquired mutations; instead, resistant cells exhibit increased BCL2 levels. Moreover, expression of a stable BCL2 mutant confers resistance to both FAKi + MEKi and FAKi+"RAF-MEK clamp" (avutometinib) treatment. Of direct translational relevance, we found that an approved BCL2 inhibitor (venetoclax) displays synergistic efficacy with FAK + MEK blockade and overcomes acquired resistance, including when combined with darovasertib, a dual PKC/PKN inhibitor limiting MEK and FAK signaling that is under clinical evaluation. Our findings suggest that resistance to FAKi + MEKi in UVM cells can be driven by an adaptive upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, and that, in turn, BCL2 inhibitors represent a promising precision-targeted strategy to overcome FAKi + MEKi treatment resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishment of an anaplastic stratification signature for gastric cancer based on diverse regulated cell-death](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1606789)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor characterized by poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The combination of Regulated cell death inducers and enhancement of the immune therapeutic effect plays an important role in cancer treatment. Methods We downloaded and analyzed data from gastric cancer samples, collected 14 Regulated cell death-related genes and constructed a Regulated Cell Death-Related Index (RCDRI) by various machine learning methods. Based on the RCDRI, gastric cancer patients were divided into high RCDRI and low RCDRI groups, and the clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration, chemotherapy response and immunotherapy response of gastric cancer patients were analyzed based on the RCDRI. Results The newly constructed RCDRI consisted of four Regulated cell death-related genes (CD36, SERPINE1, TRIML2, and GRP) and has been shown to be an effective predictive marker for the survival of gastric cancer patients and was trained with multiple external datasets. The high RCDRI group had a higher level of immune cell infiltration and better response to immunotherapy than the low RCDRI group. In addition, through pan-cancer analysis, we found that RCDRI can also be used for prognosis and immunotherapy prediction in a variety of cancers. Finally, in vitro experiments revealed that TRIML2 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. Conclusions The RCDRI identified in this study can accurately assess the prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy of gastric cancer patients, which lays a valuable foundation for future clinical treatment of gastric cancer.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Concept to Practice: an Automated LLM-aided UVM Machine for RTL Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19959v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verification presents a major bottleneck in Integrated Circuit (IC) development, consuming nearly 70% of the total development effort. While the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is widely used in industry to improve verification efficiency through structured and reusable testbenches, constructing these testbenches and generating sufficient stimuli remain challenging. These challenges arise from the considerable manual coding effort required, repetitive manual execution of multiple EDA tools, and the need for in-depth domain expertise to navigate complex designs.Here, we present UVM^2, an automated verification framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate UVM testbenches and iteratively refine them using coverage feedback, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining rigorous verification standards.To evaluate UVM^2, we introduce a benchmark suite comprising Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs of up to 1.6K lines of code.The results show that UVM^2 reduces testbench setup time by up to UVM^2 compared to experienced engineers, and achieve average code and function coverage of 87.44% and 89.58%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 20.96% and 23.51%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Integrated UVM-TLM Co-Simulation Framework for RISC-V Functional Verification and Performance Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10145v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning RISC-V ecosystem necessitates efficient verification methodologies for complex processors. Traditional approaches often struggle to concurrently evaluate functional correctness and performance, or balance simulation speed with modeling accuracy. This paper introduces an integrated co-simulation framework leveraging Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) and Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) for RISC-V processor validation. We present a configurable UVM-TLM model (vmodel) of a superscalar, out-of-order RISC-V core, featuring key microarchitectural modeling techniques such as credit-based pipeline flow control. This environment facilitates unified functional verification via co-simulation against the Spike ISA simulator and enables early-stage performance assessment using benchmarks like CoreMark, orchestrated within UVM. The methodology prioritizes integration, simulation efficiency, and acceptable fidelity for architectural exploration over cycle-level precision. Experimental results validate functional correctness and significant simulation speedup over RTL approaches, accelerating design iterations and enhancing verification coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, This work is under consideration for conference publication</p></details> |

A number of different models have been proposed, each using different rigid body dynamics or hydrodynamics algorithms, or purporting to consider different dynamic effects on the system, but most go without experimental validation of the full model, and in particular, of the coupling effect between the two systems. In this work, we return to a model combining Featherstone's rigid body dynamics algorithms with Fossen's equations for underwater dynamics by using the Julia package RigidBodyDynamics.jl. We compare the simulation's output with experimental results from pool trials with a ten degree of freedom UVMS that integrates a Reach Alpha manipulator with a BlueROV2. We validate the model's usefulness and identify its strengths and weaknesses in studying the dynamic coupling effect.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[Maximising Wrenches for Kinematically Redundant Systems with Experiments on UVMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13535v1)** | 2022-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents methods for finding optimal configurations and actuator forces/torques to maximise contact wrenches in a desired direction for Underwater Vehicles Manipulator Systems (UVMS). The wrench maximisation problem is formulated as a linear programming problem, and the optimal configuration is solved as a bi-level optimisation in the parameterised redundancy space. We additionally consider the cases of one or more manipulators with multiple contact forces, maximising wrench capability while tracking a trajectory, and generating large wrench impulses using dynamic motions. We look at the specific cases of maximising force to lift a heavy load, and maximising torque during a valve turning operation. Extensive experimental results are presented using an underwater robotic platform equipped with a 4DOF manipulator, and show significant increases in wrench capability compared to existing methods for UVMS.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[UVM Based Reusable Verification IP for Wishbone Compliant SPI Master Core](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10845v1)** | 2018-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The System on Chip design industry relies heavily on functional verification to ensure that the designs are bug-free. As design engineers are coming up with increasingly dense chips with much functionality, the functional verification field has advanced to provide modern verification techniques. In this paper, we present verification of a wishbone compliant Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Master core using a System Verilog based standard verification methodology, the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The reason for using UVM factory pattern with parameterized classes is to develop a robust and reusable verification IP. SPI is a full duplex communication protocol used to interface components most likely in embedded systems. We have verified an SPI Master IP core design that is wishbone compliant and compatible with SPI protocol and bus and furnished the results of our verification. We have used QuestaSim for simulation and analysis of waveforms, Integrated Metrics Center, Cadence for coverage analysis. We also propose interesting future directions for this work in developing reliable systems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Early Development of UVM based Verification Environment of Image Signal Processing Designs using TLM Reference Model of RTL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1150v1)** | 2014-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With semiconductor industry trend of smaller the better, from an idea to a final product, more innovation on product portfolio and yet remaining competitive and profitable are few criteria which are culminating into pressure and need for more and more innovation for CAD flow, process management and project execution cycle. Project schedules are very tight and to achieve first silicon success is key for projects. This necessitates quicker verification with better coverage matrix. Quicker Verification requires early development of the verification environment with wider test vectors without waiting for RTL to be available. In this paper, we are presenting a novel approach of early development of reusable multi-language verification flow, by addressing four major activities of verification like Early creation of Executable Specification, Early creation of Verification Environment, Early development of test vectors and Better and increased Re-use of blocks. Although this paper focuses on early development of UVM based Verification Environment of Image Signal Processing designs using TLM Reference Model of RTL, same concept can be extended for non-image signal processing designs. Main Keywords are SystemVerilog, SystemC, Transaction Level Modeling, Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), Processor model, Universal Verification Component (UVC), Reference Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 5, No. 2, 2014</p></details> |

This paper covers development of Acceleratable UVCs from standard UVCs for internal control and data buses of ST imaging group by partitioning of transaction-level components and cycle-accurate signal-level components between the software simulator and hardware accelerator respectively. Standard Co-Emulation API: Modeling Interface (SCE-MI) compliant, transaction-level communications link between test benches running on a host system and Emulation machine is established. Accelerated Verification IPs are used at UVM based Verification Environment of Image Signal Processing designs both with simulator and emulator as UVM acceleration is an extension of the standard simulation-only UVM and is fully backward compatible with it. Acceleratable UVCs significantly reduces development schedule risks while leveraging transaction models used during simulation. In this paper, we discuss our experiences on UVM based methodology adoption on TestBench-Xpress(TBX) based technology step by step. We are also doing comparison between the run time performance results from earlier simulator-only environment and the new, hardware-accelerated environment. Although this paper focuses on Acceleratable UVCs development and their usage for image signal processing designs, Same concept can be extended for non-image signal processing designs.
