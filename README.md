# Daily Papers

## Abstract
Daily Papers is an automated literature aggregation pipeline that collects, normalizes, and publishes up-to-date research digests for configurable topics. It queries arXiv and, optionally, CrossRef, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, IEEE Xplore, DVCon proceedings, and the ACM Digital Library, then consolidates the latest results into a single Markdown feed that is easy to browse and index by search engines.

## Overview
The project automatically fetches the latest papers from arXiv and optionally from CrossRef, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, IEEE, DVCon proceedings, and ACM Digital Library based on configurable keywords (for example, digital/UVM verification or other topics).

The subheadings in the README file represent the search keywords (topics).

Only the most recent articles for each keyword are retained, up to a maximum of 100 papers.
